        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) administers regulations published in title 27, chapter II, Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations are updated April 1 of each year to incorporate new or revised regulations that were published by ATF in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>during the preceding year. ATF identified several amendments that are needed to provide clarity and uniformity to the regulations it administers in 27 CFR.</P>
        <P>These amendments do not make any substantive changes and are only intended to improve the clarity of title 27, chapter II.</P>
        <P>The following sections are being amended to reflect the current control numbers issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): Sections 447.32-447.34, 447.42, 447.45, 447.57, 478.25a, 478.39a-478.40a, 478.44, 478.45, 478.52, 478.92, 478.94-478.96, 478.102, 478.112-478.114, 478.119-478.124, 478.125-478.126a, 478.131-478.133, 478.150, 479.102, 479.131, 555.109, 555.121-555.124, 555.184, and 555.201.</P>
        <P>The following sections are being amended to replace &#x201C;Chief, National Licensing Center&#x201D; with &#x201C;Chief, Federal Firearms Licensing Center&#x201D;: Sections 478.11, 478.41, 478.45, 478.47, 478.48, 478.52-478.54, 478.56, 478.57, 478.60, 478.95, and 478.127.</P>
        <P>Sections 447.35 and 447.58 are being amended to reflect ATF's current Web site address.</P>
        <P>The following sections are being amended to reflect the current address for ATF's Distribution Center and Out-of-Business Records Center: Sections 478.21, 478.124, 478.127, 479.21, 555.21, 555.23, and 555.128.</P>
        <P>Section 447.32 is being amended to reflect the current address for registration refunds regarding the importation of articles enumerated on the U.S. Munitions Import List.</P>
        <P>Sections 478.25a and 478.39a are being amended to reflect current telephone numbers.</P>
        <P>Sections 478.44, 478.45, and 478.47 are being amended to remove all references to obsolete forms.</P>
        <P>Sections 478.44 and 478.95 are being amended to reflect a nomenclature change.</P>
        <P>Section 478.96 is being amended to correct a typographical error.</P>
        <P>Section 478.125(f) is being amended to remove a repetitive sentence.</P>
        <P>Sections 478.151 and 555.109 are being amended to include the control numbers approved by OMB.</P>
        <P>Section 555.181 is being amended to remove the OMB control number, since the collection of information in this section no longer applies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">How This Document Complies With the Federal Administrative Requirements for Rulemaking</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>This rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, section 1(b), Principles of Regulation. The Department has determined that this rule is not a &#x201C;significant regulatory action&#x201D; under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), and accordingly this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Executive Order 13132</HD>
        <P>This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with section 6 of Executive Order 13132, the Attorney General has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism summary impact statement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Executive Order 12988</HD>
        <P>This regulation meets the applicable standards set forth in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Administrative Procedure Act</HD>

        <P>This rule relates to a matter of agency management or personnel and is a rule of agency organization, procedure, and practice. As such, this rule is exempt from the usual requirements of prior notice and comment and a 30-day delay in the effective date.<E T="03">See</E>5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2), (b)(3)(A), (d)(3). Moreover, the Department finds good cause for exempting the rule from those requirements. Because this final rule merely makes technical corrections to improve the clarity of the regulations, the Department finds it unnecessary to publish this rule for public notice and comment. Similarly, because delaying the effective date of this rule would serve no purpose, the Department also finds good cause to make this rule effective upon publication.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to an initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis are not applicable to this rule because the agency was not required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a major rule as defined by section 251 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 5 U.S.C. 804. This rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based companies to compete with foreign-based companies in domestic and export markets.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>

        <P>This rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100 million or more in any one year, and it will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.<PRTPAGE P="57240"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</HD>
        <P>This final rule does not impose any new reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Congressional Review Act</HD>
        <P>This action pertains to agency organization, procedure, or practice, and does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties and, accordingly, is not a &#x201C;rule&#x201D; as that term is used by the Congressional Review Act (Subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996). Therefore, the reporting requirement of 5 U.S.C. 801 does not apply.</P>

Payment of the license fee as an importer or manufacturer of destructive devices, ammunition for destructive devices or armor piercing ammunition or as a dealer in destructive devices includes the privilege of importing or manufacturing firearms other than destructive devices and ammunition for other than destructive devices or ammunition other than armor piercing ammunition, or dealing in firearms other than destructive devices, as the case may be, by such a licensee at the licensed premises.</P>
