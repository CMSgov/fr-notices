fr-notices
==========

This is part of the [eRegulations](http://eregs.github.io/eRegulations/) project.

In some cases, we edit the XML for a Federal Register notice to make it easier
to parse with regulations-parser (which has two versions: the [CFPB regulations-parser](https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-parser) and a [non-agency-specific regulations-parser maintained by 18F](https://github.com/18F/regulations-parser)). This repository is a canonical place to store those edits, across all agencies, so that developers remain in sync.

**Note**: These are unofficial changes. All official notices are available through the [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/) - for example, [here are CFPB notices](https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/consumer-financial-protection-bureau).

## Usage

Use these notices with regulations-parser as part of eRegulations.
