        <P>(h) The requirements of this part apply to owners or operators of all facilities which treat, store, or dispose of hazardous wastes referred to in part 268.</P>
        <P>(i) Section 266.205 of this chapter identifies when the requirements of this part apply to the storage of military munitions classified as solid waste under § 266.202 of this chapter. The treatment and disposal of hazardous waste military munitions are subject to the applicable permitting, procedural, and technical standards in 40 CFR parts 260 through 270.</P>
        <P>(j) The requirements of subparts B, C, and D of this part and § 264.101 do not apply to remediation waste management sites. (However, some remediation waste management sites may be a part of a facility that is subject to a traditional RCRA permit because the facility is also treating, storing or disposing of hazardous wastes that are not remediation wastes. In these cases, Subparts B, C, and D of this part, and § 264.101 do apply to the facility subject to the traditional RCRA permit.) Instead of the requirements of subparts B, C, and D of this part, owners or operators of remediation waste management sites must:</P>
        <P>(1) Obtain an EPA identification number by applying to the Administrator using EPA Form 8700-12;</P>
        <P>(2) Obtain a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative sample of the hazardous remediation wastes to be managed at the site. At a minimum, the analysis must contain all of the information which must be known to treat, store or dispose of the waste according to this part and part 268 of this chapter, and must be kept accurate and up to date;</P>
        <P>(3) Prevent people who are unaware of the danger from entering, and minimize the possibility for unauthorized people or livestock to enter onto the active portion of the remediation waste management site, unless the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Director that:</P>
        <P>(i) Physical contact with the waste, structures, or equipment within the active portion of the remediation waste management site will not injure people or livestock who may enter the active portion of the remediation waste management site; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Disturbance of the waste or equipment by people or livestock who enter onto the active portion of the remediation waste management site, will not cause a violation of the requirements of this part;</P>
        <P>(4) Inspect the remediation waste management site for malfunctions, deterioration, operator errors, and discharges that may be causing, or may lead to, a release of hazardous waste constituents to the environment, or a threat to human health. The owner or operator must conduct these inspections often enough to identify problems in time to correct them before they harm human health or the environment, and must remedy the problem before it leads to a human health or environmental hazard. Where a hazard is imminent or has already occurred, the owner/operator must take remedial action immediately;</P>
        <P>(5) Provide personnel with classroom or on-the-job training on how to perform their duties in a way that ensures the remediation waste management site complies with the requirements of this part, and on how to respond effectively to emergencies;</P>
        <P>(6) Take precautions to prevent accidental ignition or reaction of ignitable or reactive waste, and prevent threats to human health and the environment from ignitable, reactive and incompatible waste;</P>

        <P>(7) For remediation waste management sites subject to regulation under subparts I through O and subpart X of this part, the owner/operator must design, construct, operate, and maintain a unit within a 100-year floodplain to <PRTPAGE P="423"/>prevent washout of any hazardous waste by a 100-year flood, unless the owner/operator can meet the demonstration of § 264.18(b);</P>
        <P>(8) Not place any non-containerized or bulk liquid hazardous waste in any salt dome formation, salt bed formation, underground mine or cave;</P>
        <P>(9) Develop and maintain a construction quality assurance program for all surface impoundments, waste piles and landfill units that are required to comply with §§ 264.221(c) and (d), 264.251(c) and (d), and 264.301(c) and (d) at the remediation waste management site, according to the requirements of § 264.19;</P>
        <P>(10) Develop and maintain procedures to prevent accidents and a contingency and emergency plan to control accidents that occur. These procedures must address proper design, construction, maintenance, and operation of remediation waste management units at the site. The goal of the plan must be to minimize the possibility of, and the hazards from a fire, explosion, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water that could threaten human health or the environment. The plan must explain specifically how to treat, store and dispose of the hazardous remediation waste in question, and must be implemented immediately whenever a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could threaten human health or the environment;</P>
        <P>(11) Designate at least one employee, either on the facility premises or on call (that is, available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility quickly), to coordinate all emergency response measures. This emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of waste handled, the location of all records within the facility, and the facility layout. In addition, this person must have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan;</P>
        <P>(12) Develop, maintain and implement a plan to meet the requirements in paragraphs (j)(2) through (j)(6) and (j)(9) through (j)(10) of this section; and</P>
        <P>(13) Maintain records documenting compliance with paragraphs (j)(1) through (j)(12) of this section.</P>

        <P>(a) The owner or operator must inspect his facility for malfunctions and deterioration, operator errors, and discharges which may be causing—or may lead to—(1) release of hazardous waste constituents to the environment or (2) a threat to human health. The owner or operator must conduct these inspections often enough to identify problems in time to correct them before they harm human health or the environment.</P>
        <P>(b)(1) The owner or operator must develop and follow a written schedule for inspecting monitoring equipment, safety and emergency equipment, security devices, and operating and structural equipment (such as dikes and sump pumps) that are important to preventing, detecting, or responding to environmental or human health hazards.</P>
        <P>(2) He must keep this schedule at the facility.</P>
        <P>(3) The schedule must identify the types of problems (e.g., malfunctions or deterioration) which are to be looked for during the inspection (e.g., inoperative sump pump, leaking fitting, eroding dike, etc.).</P>

        <P>(4) The frequency of inspection may vary for the items on the schedule. However, the frequency should be based on the rate of deterioration of the equipment and the probability of an environmental or human health incident if the deterioration, malfunction, or operator error goes undetected between inspections. Areas subject to spills, such as loading and unloading areas, must be inspected daily when in use, except for Performance Track member facilities, that must inspect at least once each month, upon approval by the Director, as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. At a minimum, the inspection schedule must include the items and frequencies called for in §§ 264.174, 264.193, 264.195, 264.226, 264.254, 264.278, 264.303, 264.347, 264.602, 264.1033, 264.1052, 264.1053, 264.1058, and 264.1083 through 264.1089 of this part, where applicable.

The modification request must also specify, in writing, that the reduced inspection frequency will apply for as long as the facility is a Performance Track member facility, and that within seven calendar days of ceasing to be a Performance Track member, the facility will revert to the non-Performance Track inspection frequency. Inspections must be conducted at least once each month.</P>
        <P>(ii) Within 60 days, the Director will notify the Performance Track member facility, in writing, if the request is approved, denied, or if an extension to the 60-day deadline is needed. This notice must be placed in the facility's operating record. The Performance Track member facility should consider the application approved if the Director does not: deny the application; or notify the Performance Track member facility of an extension to the 60-day deadline. In these situations, the Performance Track member facility must adhere to the revised inspection schedule outlined in its request for a Class 1 permit modification and keep a copy of the application in the facility's operating record.</P>

He may do this by observation or review of facility records or manifests, and, if necessary, by chemical analysis.</P>
        <P>(c) Concurrently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (e.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-off from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions).</P>

        <P>(e) During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing release waste, and removing or isolating containers.</P>
        <P>(f) If the facility stops operations in response to a fire, explosion, or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate.</P>

        <P>(d) Within three (3) working days of the receipt of a shipment subject to 40 CFR part 262, subpart H, the owner or operator of a facility must provide a copy of the movement document bearing all required signatures to the exporter, to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Federal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460, and to competent authorities of all other concerned countries. The original copy of the movement document must be maintained at the facility for at least three (3) years from the date of signature.</P>
        <P>(e) A facility must determine whether the consignment state for a shipment regulates any additional wastes (beyond those regulated Federally) as hazardous wastes under its state hazardous waste program. Facilities must also determine whether the consignment state or generator state requires the facility to submit any copies of the manifest to these states.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Legal equivalence to paper manifests.</E> Electronic manifests that are obtained, completed, and transmitted in accordance with § 262.20(a)(3) of this chapter, and used in accordance with this section in lieu of the paper manifest form are the legal equivalent of paper manifest forms bearing handwritten signatures, and satisfy for all purposes any requirement in these regulations to obtain, complete, sign, provide, use, or retain a manifest.</P>
        <P>(1) Any requirement in these regulations for the owner or operator of a facility to sign a manifest or manifest certification by hand, or to obtain a handwritten signature, is satisfied by signing with or obtaining a valid and enforceable electronic signature within the meaning of 40 CFR 262.25.</P>
        <P>(2) Any requirement in these regulations to give, provide, send, forward, or to return to another person a copy of the manifest is satisfied when a copy of an electronic manifest is transmitted to the other person.</P>
        <P>(3) Any requirement in these regulations for a manifest to accompany a hazardous waste shipment is satisfied when a copy of an electronic manifest is accessible during transportation and forwarded to the person or persons who are scheduled to receive delivery of the waste shipment.</P>
        <P>(4) Any requirement in these regulations for an owner or operator to keep or retain a copy of each manifest is satisfied by the retention of the facility's electronic manifest copies in its account on the e-Manifest system, provided that such copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized state inspector.</P>
        <P>(5) No owner or operator may be held liable for the inability to produce an electronic manifest for inspection under this section if the owner or operator can demonstrate that the inability to produce the electronic manifest is due exclusively to a technical difficulty with the electronic manifest system for which the owner or operator bears no responsibility.</P>
        <P>(g) An owner or operator may participate in the electronic manifest system either by accessing the electronic manifest system from the owner's or operator's electronic equipment, or by accessing the electronic manifest system from portable equipment brought to the owner's or operator's site by the transporter who delivers the waste shipment to the facility.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Special procedures applicable to replacement manifests.</E> If a facility receives hazardous waste that is accompanied by a paper replacement manifest for a manifest that was originated electronically, the following procedures apply to the delivery of the hazardous waste by the final transporter:</P>

        <P>(1) Upon delivery of the hazardous waste to the designated facility, the owner or operator must sign and date each copy of the paper replacement manifest by hand in Item 20 (Designated Facility Certification of Receipt) and note any discrepancies in Item 18 (Discrepancy Indication Space) of the paper replacement manifest,<PRTPAGE P="438"/>
        </P>
        <P>(2) The owner or operator of the facility must give back to the final transporter one copy of the paper replacement manifest,</P>
        <P>(3) Within 30 days of delivery of the waste to the designated facility, the owner or operator of the facility must send one signed and dated copy of the paper replacement manifest to the generator, and send an additional signed and dated copy of the paper replacement manifest to the electronic manifest system, and</P>
        <P>(4) The owner or operator of the facility must retain at the facility one copy of the paper replacement manifest for at least three years from the date of delivery.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Special procedures applicable to electronic signature methods undergoing tests.</E> If an owner or operator using an electronic manifest signs this manifest electronically using an electronic signature method which is undergoing pilot or demonstration tests aimed at demonstrating the practicality or legal dependability of the signature method, then the owner or operator shall also sign with an ink signature the facility's certification of receipt or discrepancies on the printed copy of the manifest provided by the transporter. Upon executing its ink signature on this printed copy, the owner or operator shall retain this original copy among its records for at least 3 years from the date of delivery of the waste.</P>
        <P>(j) <E T="03">Imposition of user fee for electronic manifest use.</E> An owner or operator who is a user of the electronic manifest format may be assessed a user fee by EPA for the origination or processing of each electronic manifest. An owner or operator may also be assessed a user fee by EPA for the collection and processing of paper manifest copies that owners or operators must submit to the electronic manifest system operator under § 264.71(a)(2)(v). EPA shall maintain and update from time-to-time the current schedule of electronic manifest system user fees, which shall be determined based on current and projected system costs and level of use of the electronic manifest system. The current schedule of electronic manifest user fees shall be published as an appendix to part 262 of this chapter.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Manifest discrepancies.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Manifest discrepancies are:</P>
        <P>(1) Significant differences (as defined by paragraph (b) of this section) between the quantity or type of hazardous waste designated on the manifest or shipping paper, and the quantity and type of hazardous waste a facility actually receives;</P>
        <P>(2) Rejected wastes, which may be a full or partial shipment of hazardous waste that the TSDF cannot accept; or</P>
        <P>(3) Container residues, which are residues that exceed the quantity limits for “empty” containers set forth in 40 CFR 261.7(b).</P>
        <P>(b) Significant differences in quantity are: For bulk waste, variations greater than 10 percent in weight; for batch waste, any variation in piece count, such as a discrepancy of one drum in a truckload. Significant differences in type are obvious differences which can be discovered by inspection or waste analysis, such as waste solvent substituted for waste acid, or toxic constituents not reported on the manifest or shipping paper.</P>

        <P>(c) Upon discovering a significant difference in quantity or type, the owner or operator must attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the waste generator or transporter (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> with telephone conversations). If the discrepancy is not resolved within 15 days after receiving the waste, the owner or operator must immediately submit to the Regional Administrator a letter describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a copy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue.</P>

        <P>(d)(1) Upon rejecting waste or identifying a container residue that exceeds the quantity limits for “empty” containers set forth in 40 CFR 261.7(b), the facility must consult with the generator prior to forwarding the waste to another facility that can manage the waste. If it is impossible to locate an alternative facility that can receive <PRTPAGE P="439"/>the waste, the facility may return the rejected waste or residue to the generator. The facility must send the waste to the alternative facility or to the generator within 60 days of the rejection or the container residue identification.</P>
        <P>(2) While the facility is making arrangements for forwarding rejected wastes or residues to another facility under this section, it must ensure that either the delivering transporter retains custody of the waste, or, the facility must provide for secure, temporary custody of the waste, pending delivery of the waste to the first transporter designated on the manifest prepared under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section.</P>
        <P>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, for full or partial load rejections and residues that are to be sent off-site to an alternate facility, the facility is required to prepare a new manifest in accordance with § 262.20(a) of this chapter and the following instructions:</P>
        <P>(1) Write the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in Item 1 of the new manifest. Write the generator's name and mailing address in Item 5 of the new manifest. If the mailing address is different from the generator's site address, then write the generator's site address in the designated space for Item 5.</P>
        <P>(2) Write the name of the alternate designated facility and the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated facility block (Item 8) of the new manifest.</P>
        <P>(3) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the old manifest to the Special Handling and Additional Information Block of the new manifest, and indicate that the shipment is a residue or rejected waste from the previous shipment.</P>
        <P>(4) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference number line in the Discrepancy Block of the old manifest (Item 18a).</P>
        <P>(5) Write the DOT description for the rejected load or the residue in Item 9 (U.S. DOT Description) of the new manifest and write the container types, quantity, and volume(s) of waste.</P>
        <P>(6) Sign the Generator's/Offeror's Certification to certify, as the offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been properly packaged, marked and labeled and is in proper condition for transportation, and mail a signed copy of the manifest to the generator identified in Item 5 of the new manifest.</P>
        <P>(7) For full load rejections that are made while the transporter remains present at the facility, the facility may forward the rejected shipment to the alternate facility by completing Item 18b of the original manifest and supplying the information on the next destination facility in the Alternate Facility space. The facility must retain a copy of this manifest for its records, and then give the remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany the shipment. If the original manifest is not used, then the facility must use a new manifest and comply with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section.</P>
        <P>(f) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(7) of this section, for rejected wastes and residues that must be sent back to the generator, the facility is required to prepare a new manifest in accordance with § 262.20(a) of this chapter and the following instructions:</P>
        <P>(1) Write the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in Item 1 of the new manifest. Write the facility's name and mailing address in Item 5 of the new manifest. If the mailing address is different from the facility's site address, then write the facility's site address in the designated space for Item 5 of the new manifest.</P>
        <P>(2) Write the name of the initial generator and the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated facility block (Item 8) of the new manifest.</P>
        <P>(3) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the old manifest to the Special Handling and Additional Information Block of the new manifest, and indicate that the shipment is a residue or rejected waste from the previous shipment.</P>
        <P>(4) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference number line in the Discrepancy Block of the old manifest (Item 18a).</P>

        <P>(5) Write the DOT description for the rejected load or the residue in Item 9 (U.S. DOT Description) of the new <PRTPAGE P="440"/>manifest and write the container types, quantity, and volume(s) of waste.</P>
        <P>(6) Sign the Generator's/Offeror's Certification to certify, as offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been properly packaged, marked and labeled and is in proper condition for transportation.</P>
        <P>(7) For full load rejections that are made while the transporter remains at the facility, the facility may return the shipment to the generator with the original manifest by completing Item 18a and 18b of the manifest and supplying the generator's information in the Alternate Facility space. The facility must retain a copy for its records and then give the remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany the shipment. If the original manifest is not used, then the facility must use a new manifest and comply with paragraphs (f)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8) of this section.</P>
        <P>(8) For full or partial load rejections and container residues contained in non-empty containers that are returned to the generator, the facility must also comply with the exception reporting requirements in § 262.42(a).</P>
        <P>(g) If a facility rejects a waste or identifies a container residue that exceeds the quantity limits for “empty” containers set forth in 40 CFR 261.7(b) after it has signed, dated, and returned a copy of the manifest to the delivering transporter or to the generator, the facility must amend its copy of the manifest to indicate the rejected wastes or residues in the discrepancy space of the amended manifest. The facility must also copy the manifest tracking number from Item 4 of the new manifest to the Discrepancy space of the amended manifest, and must re-sign and date the manifest to certify to the information as amended. The facility must retain the amended manifest for at least three years from the date of amendment, and must within 30 days, send a copy of the amended manifest to the transporter and generator that received copies prior to their being amended.</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 264.90</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this subpart apply to owners or operators of facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. The owner or operator must satisfy the requirements identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for all wastes (or constituents thereof) contained in solid waste management units at the facility, regardless of the time at which waste was placed in such units.</P>
        <P>(2) All solid waste management units must comply with the requirements in § 264.101. A surface impoundment, waste pile, and land treatment unit or landfill that receives hazardous waste after July 26, 1982 (hereinafter referred to as a “regulated unit”) must comply with the requirements of §§ 264.91 through 264.100 in lieu of § 264.101 for purposes of detecting, characterizing and responding to releases to the uppermost aquifer. The financial responsibility requirements of § 264.101 apply to regulated units.</P>
        <P>(b) The owner or operator's regulated unit or units are not subject to regulation for releases into the uppermost aquifer under this subpart if:</P>
        <P>(1) The owner or operator is exempted under § 264.1; or</P>
        <P>(2) He operates a unit which the Regional Administrator finds:</P>
        <P>(i) Is an engineered structure,</P>
        <P>(ii) Does not receive or contain liquid waste or waste containing free liquids,</P>
        <P>(iii) Is designed and operated to exclude liquid, precipitation, and other run-on and run-off,</P>
        <P>(iv) Has both inner and outer layers of containment enclosing the waste,</P>
        <P>(v) Has a leak detection system built into each containment layer,</P>
        <P>(vi) The owner or operator will provide continuing operation and maintenance of these leak detection systems during the active life of the unit and the closure and post-closure care periods, and</P>
        <P>(vii) To a reasonable degree of certainty, will not allow hazardous constituents to migrate beyond the outer containment layer prior to the end of the post-closure care period.</P>
        <P>(3) The Regional Administrator finds, pursuant to § 264.280(d), that the treatment zone of a land treatment unit that qualifies as a regulated unit does not contain levels of hazardous constituents that are above background levels of those constituents by an amount that is statistically significant, and if an unsaturated zone monitoring program meeting the requirements of § 264.278 has not shown a statistically significant increase in hazardous constituents below the treatment zone during the operating life of the unit. An exemption under this paragraph can only relieve an owner or operator of responsibility to meet the requirements of this subpart during the post-closure care period; or</P>
        <P>(4) The Regional Administrator finds that there is no potential for migration of liquid from a regulated unit to the uppermost aquifer during the active life of the regulated unit (including the closure period) and the post-closure care period specified under § 264.117. This demonstration must be certified by a qualified geologist or geotechnical engineer. In order to provide an adequate margin of safety in the prediction of potential migration of liquid, the owner or operator must base any predictions made under this paragraph on assumptions that maximize the rate of liquid migration.</P>
        <P>(5) He designs and operates a pile in compliance with § 264.250(c).</P>
        <P>(c) The regulations under this subpart apply during the active life of the regulated unit (including the closure period). After closure of the regulated unit, the regulations in this subpart:</P>
        <P>(1) Do not apply if all waste, waste residues, contaminated containment system components, and contaminated subsoils are removed or decontaminated at closure;</P>
        <P>(2) Apply during the post-closure care period under § 264.117 if the owner or operator is conducting a detection monitoring program under § 264.98; or</P>
        <P>(3) Apply during the compliance period under § 264.96 if the owner or operator is conducting a compliance monitoring program under § 264.99 or a corrective action program under § 264.100.</P>

        <P>(d) Regulations in this subpart may apply to miscellaneous units when necessary to comply with §§ 264.601 through 264.603.<PRTPAGE P="444"/>
        </P>
        <P>(e) The regulations of this subpart apply to all owners and operators subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7), when the Agency issues either a post-closure permit or an enforceable document (as defined in 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7)) at the facility. When the Agency issues an enforceable document, references in this subpart to “in the permit” mean “in the enforceable document.”</P>
        <P>(f) The Regional Administrator may replace all or part of the requirements of §§ 264.91 through 264.100 applying to a regulated unit with alternative requirements for groundwater monitoring and corrective action for releases to groundwater set out in the permit (or in an enforceable document) (as defined in 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7)) where the Regional Administrator determines that:</P>
        <P>(1) The regulated unit is situated among solid waste management units (or areas of concern), a release has occurred, and both the regulated unit and one or more solid waste management unit(s) (or areas of concern) are likely to have contributed to the release; and</P>
        <P>(2) It is not necessary to apply the groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements of §§ 264.91 through 264.100 because alternative requirements will protect human health and the environment.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Required programs.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Owners and operators subject to this subpart must conduct a monitoring and response program as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) Whenever hazardous constituents under § 264.93 from a regulated unit are detected at a compliance point under § 264.95, the owner or operator must institute a compliance monitoring program under § 264.99. Detected is defined as statistically significant evidence of contamination as described in § 264.98(f);</P>
        <P>(2) Whenever the ground-water protection standard under § 264.92 is exceeded, the owner or operator must institute a corrective action program under § 264.100. Exceeded is defined as statistically significant evidence of increased contamination as described in § 264.99(d);</P>
        <P>(3) Whenever hazardous constituents under § 264.93 from a regulated unit exceed concentration limits under § 264.94 in ground water between the compliance point under § 264.95 and the downgradient facility property boundary, the owner or operator must institute a corrective action program under § 264.100; or</P>
        <P>(4) In all other cases, the owner or operator must institute a detection monitoring program under § 264.98.</P>
        <P>(b) The Regional Administrator will specify in the facility permit the specific elements of the monitoring and response program. The Regional Administrator may include one or more of the programs identified in paragraph (a) of this section in the facility permit as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment and will specify the circumstances under which each of the programs will be required. In deciding whether to require the owner or operator to be prepared to institute a particular program, the Regional Administrator will consider the potential adverse effects on human health and the environment that might occur before final administrative action on a permit modification application to incorporate such a program could be taken.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Hazardous constituents.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) The Regional Administrator will specify in the facility permit the hazardous constituents to which the ground-water protection standard of § 264.92 applies. Hazardous constituents are constituents identified in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter that have been detected in ground water in the uppermost aquifer underlying a regulated unit and that are reasonably expected to be in or derived from waste contained in a regulated unit, unless the Regional Administrator has excluded them under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
        <P>(b) The Regional Administrator will exclude an appendix VIII constituent from the list of hazardous constituents specified in the facility permit if he finds that the constituent is not capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Regional Administrator will consider the following:</P>
        <P>(1) Potential adverse effects on ground-water quality, considering:</P>
        <P>(i) The physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit, including its potential for migration;</P>
        <P>(ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and surrounding land;</P>
        <P>(iii) The quantity of ground water and the direction of ground-water flow;</P>

        <P>(v) The current and future uses of ground water in the area;</P>
        <P>(vi) The existing quality of ground water, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impact on the ground-water quality;</P>
        <P>(vii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents;</P>
        <P>(viii) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents;</P>
        <P>(ix) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects; and</P>

        <P>(iii) The quantity and quality of ground water, and the direction of ground-water flow;</P>
        <P>(iv) The patterns of rainfall in the region;</P>
        <P>(v) The proximity of the regulated unit to surface waters;</P>
        <P>(vi) The current and future uses of surface waters in the area and any water quality standards established for those surface waters;</P>
        <P>(vii) The existing quality of surface water, including other sources of contamination and the cumulative impact on surface-water quality;</P>
        <P>(viii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents;</P>
        <P>(ix) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and</P>
        <P>(x) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects.</P>
        <P>(c) In making any determination under paragraph (b) of this section about the use of ground water in the area around the facility, the Regional Administrator will consider any identification of underground sources of drinking water and exempted aquifers made under § 144.8 of this chapter.</P>

        <SUBJECT>General ground-water monitoring requirements.</SUBJECT>
        <P>The owner or operator must comply with the following requirements for any ground-water monitoring program developed to satisfy § 264.98, § 264.99, or § 264.100:</P>
        <P>(a) The ground-water monitoring system must consist of a sufficient number of wells, installed at appropriate locations and depths to yield ground-water samples from the uppermost aquifer that:</P>
        <P>(1) Represent the quality of background ground water that has not been affected by leakage from a regulated unit;</P>
        <P>(i) A determination of background ground-water quality may include sampling of wells that are not hydraulically upgradient of the waste management area where:</P>
        <P>(A) Hydrogeologic conditions do not allow the owner or operator to determine what wells are hydraulically upgradient; and</P>
        <P>(B) Sampling at other wells will provide an indication of background ground-water quality that is representative or more representative than that provided by the upgradient wells; and</P>
        <P>(2) Represent the quality of ground water passing the point of compliance.</P>
        <P>(3) Allow for the detection of contamination when hazardous waste or hazardous constituents have migrated from the waste management area to the uppermost aquifer.</P>
        <P>(b) If a facility contains more than one regulated unit, separate ground-water monitoring systems are not required for each regulated unit provided that provisions for sampling the ground water in the uppermost aquifer will enable detection and measurement at the compliance point of hazardous constituents from the regulated units that have entered the ground water in the uppermost aquifer.</P>
        <P>(c) All monitoring wells must be cased in a manner that maintains the integrity of the monitoring-well bore hole. This casing must be screened or perforated and packed with gravel or sand, where necessary, to enable collection of ground-water samples. The annular space (i.e., the space between the bore hole and well casing) above the sampling depth must be sealed to prevent contamination of samples and the ground water.</P>
        <P>(d) The ground-water monitoring program must include consistent sampling and analysis procedures that are designed to ensure monitoring results that provide a reliable indication of ground-water quality below the waste management area. At a minimum the program must include procedures and techniques for:</P>
        <P>(1) Sample collection;<PRTPAGE P="448"/>
        </P>
        <P>(2) Sample preservation and shipment;</P>
        <P>(3) Analytical procedures; and</P>
        <P>(4) Chain of custody control.</P>
        <P>(e) The ground-water monitoring program must include sampling and analytical methods that are appropriate for ground-water sampling and that accurately measure hazardous constituents in ground-water samples.</P>
        <P>(f) The ground-water monitoring program must include a determination of the ground-water surface elevation each time ground water is sampled.</P>
        <P>(g) In detection monitoring or where appropriate in compliance monitoring, data on each hazardous constituent specified in the permit will be collected from background wells and wells at the compliance point(s). The number and kinds of samples collected to establish background shall be appropriate for the form of statistical test employed, following generally accepted statistical principles. The sample size shall be as large as necessary to ensure with reasonable confidence that a contaminant release to ground water from a facility will be detected. The owner or operator will determine an appropriate sampling procedure and interval for each hazardous constituent listed in the facility permit which shall be specified in the unit permit upon approval by the Regional Administrator. This sampling procedure shall be:</P>
        <P>(1) A sequence of at least four samples, taken at an interval that assures, to the greatest extent technically feasible, that an independent sample is obtained, by reference to the uppermost aquifer's effective porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and hydraulic gradient, and the fate and transport characteristics of the potential contaminants, or</P>
        <P>(2) an alternate sampling procedure proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(h) The owner or operator will specify one of the following statistical methods to be used in evaluating ground-water monitoring data for each hazardous constituent which, upon approval by the Regional Administrator, will be specified in the unit permit. The statistical test chosen shall be conducted separately for each hazardous constituent in each well. Where practical quantification limits (pql's) are used in any of the following statistical procedures to comply with § 264.97(i)(5), the pql must be proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator. Use of any of the following statistical methods must be protective of human health and the environment and must comply with the performance standards outlined in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
        <P>(1) A parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparisons procedures to identify statistically significant evidence of contamination. The method must include estimation and testing of the contrasts between each compliance well's mean and the background mean levels for each constituent.</P>
        <P>(2) An analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on ranks followed by multiple comparisons procedures to identify statistically significant evidence of contamination. The method must include estimation and testing of the contrasts between each compliance well's median and the background median levels for each constituent.</P>
        <P>(3) A tolerance or prediction interval procedure in which an interval for each constituent is established from the distribution of the background data, and the level of each constituent in each compliance well is compared to the upper tolerance or prediction limit.</P>
        <P>(4) A control chart approach that gives control limits for each constituent.</P>
        <P>(5) Another statistical test method submitted by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(i) Any statistical method chosen under § 264.97(h) for specification in the unit permit shall comply with the following performance standards, as appropriate:</P>

        <P>(1) The statistical method used to evaluate ground-water monitoring data shall be appropriate for the distribution of chemical parameters or hazardous constituents. If the distribution of the chemical parameters or hazardous constituents is shown by the owner or operator to be inappropriate for a normal theory test, then the data <PRTPAGE P="449"/>should be transformed or a distribution-free theory test should be used. If the distributions for the constituents differ, more than one statistical method may be needed.</P>
        <P>(2) If an individual well comparison procedure is used to compare an individual compliance well constituent concentration with background constituent concentrations or a ground-water protection standard, the test shall be done at a Type I error level no less than 0.01 for each testing period. If a multiple comparisons procedure is used, the Type I experimentwise error rate for each testing period shall be no less than 0.05; however, the Type I error of no less than 0.01 for individual well comparisons must be maintained. This performance standard does not apply to tolerance intervals, prediction intervals or control charts.</P>
        <P>(3) If a control chart approach is used to evaluate ground-water monitoring data, the specific type of control chart and its associated parameter values shall be proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator if he or she finds it to be protective of human health and the environment.</P>
        <P>(4) If a tolerance interval or a prediction interval is used to evaluate groundwater monitoring data, the levels of confidence and, for tolerance intervals, the percentage of the population that the interval must contain, shall be proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator if he or she finds these parameters to be protective of human health and the environment. These parameters will be determined after considering the number of samples in the background data base, the data distribution, and the range of the concentration values for each constituent of concern.</P>
        <P>(5) The statistical method shall account for data below the limit of detection with one or more statistical procedures that are protective of human health and the environment. Any practical quantification limit (pql) approved by the Regional Administrator under § 264.97(h) that is used in the statistical method shall be the lowest concentration level that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions that are available to the facility.</P>
        <P>(6) If necessary, the statistical method shall include procedures to control or correct for seasonal and spatial variability as well as temporal correlation in the data.</P>
        <P>(j) Ground-water monitoring data collected in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section including actual levels of constituents must be maintained in the facility operating record. The Regional Administrator will specify in the permit when the data must be submitted for review.</P>

        <P>(1) The types, quantities, and concentrations of constituents in wastes managed at the regulated unit;</P>
        <P>(2) The mobility, stability, and persistence of waste constituents or their reaction products in the unsaturated zone beneath the waste management area;</P>
        <P>(3) The detectability of indicator parameters, waste constituents, and reaction products in ground water; and</P>
        <P>(4) The concentrations or values and coefficients of variation of proposed monitoring parameters or constituents in the ground-water background.</P>

        <P>(b) The owner or operator must install a ground-water monitoring system at the compliance point as specified under § 264.95. The ground-water <PRTPAGE P="450"/>monitoring system must comply with § 264.97(a)(2), (b), and (c).</P>
        <P>(c) The owner or operator must conduct a ground-water monitoring program for each chemical parameter and hazardous constituent specified in the permit pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with § 264.97(g). The owner or operator must maintain a record of ground-water analytical data as measured and in a form necessary for the determination of statistical significance under § 264.97(h).</P>
        <P>(d) The Regional Administrator will specify the frequencies for collecting samples and conducting statistical tests to determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination for any parameter or hazardous constituent specified in the permit conditions under paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with § 264.97(g).</P>

These method(s) must compare data collected at the compliance point(s) to the background ground-water quality data.</P>
        <P>(2) The owner or operator must determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination at each monitoring well as the compliance point within a reasonable period of time after completion of sampling.

        <P>(2) Immediately sample the ground water in all monitoring wells and determine whether constituents in the list of appendix IX of this part are present, and if so, in what concentration. However, the Regional Administrator, on a discretionary basis, may allow sampling for a site-specific subset of constituents from the appendix IX list of this part and other representative/related waste constituents.</P>
        <P>(3) For any appendix IX compounds found in the analysis pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the owner or operator may resample within one month or at an alternative site-specific schedule approved by the Administrator and repeat the analysis for those compounds detected. If the results of the second analysis confirm the initial results, then these constituents will form the basis for compliance monitoring.

        <P>(1) The owner or operator must conduct a sampling program for each chemical parameter or hazardous constituent in accordance with § 264.97(g).</P>
        <P>(2) The owner or operator must record ground-water analytical data as measured and in form necessary for the determination of statistical significance under § 264.97(h) for the compliance period of the facility.</P>
        <P>(d) The owner or operator must determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of increased contamination for any chemical parameter or hazardous constituent specified in the permit, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, at a frequency specified under paragraph (f) under this section.</P>
        <P>(1) In determining whether statistically significant evidence of increased contamination exists, the owner or operator must use the method(s) specified in the permit under § 264.97(h). The methods(s) must compare data collected at the compliance point(s) to a concentration limit developed in accordance with § 264.94.</P>
        <P>(2) The owner or operator must determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of increased contamination at each monitoring well at the compliance point within a reasonable time period after completion of sampling. The Regional Administrator will specify that time period in the facility permit, after considering the complexity of the statistical test and the availability of laboratory facilities to perform the analysis of ground-water samples.</P>
        <P>(e) The owner or operator must determine the ground-water flow rate and direction in the uppermost aquifer at least annually.</P>

        <P>(g) Annually, the owner or operator must determine whether additional hazardous constituents from appendix IX of this part, which could possibly be present but are not on the detection monitoring list in the permit, are actually present in the uppermost aquifer and, if so, at what concentration, pursuant to procedures in § 264.98(f). To accomplish this, the owner or operator must consult with the Regional Administrator to determine on a case-by-case basis: which sample collection event during the year will involve enhanced sampling; the number of monitoring wells at the compliance point to undergo enhanced sampling; the number of samples to be collected from each of these monitoring wells; and, the specific constituents from appendix IX of this part for which these samples must be analyzed. If the enhanced sampling event indicates that appendix IX constituents are present in the ground water that are not already identified in the permit as monitoring constituents, the owner or operator may resample within one month or at an alternative site-specific schedule approved by the Regional Administrator, and repeat the analysis. If the second analysis confirms the presence of new constituents, the owner or operator must report the concentration of these additional constituents to the Regional Administrator within seven days after the completion of the second analysis and add them to the monitoring list. If the owner or operator chooses not to resample, then he or she must report the concentrations of these additional constituents to the Regional Administrator within seven days after completion of the initial analysis, and add them to the monitoring list.</P>

        <P>(ii) A plan for a ground-water monitoring program that will demonstrate the effectiveness of the corrective action. Such a ground-water monitoring program may be based on a compliance monitoring program developed to meet the requirements of this section.</P>
        <P>(i) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, that the ground-water concentration limits under this section are being exceeded at any monitoring well at the point of compliance, he or she may demonstrate that a source other than a regulated unit caused the contamination or that the detection is an artifact caused by an error in sampling, analysis, or statistical evaluation or natural variation in the ground water. In making a demonstration under this paragraph, the owner or operator must:</P>
        <P>(1) Notify the Regional Administrator in writing within seven days that he intends to make a demonstration under this paragraph;</P>

Such a monitoring program may be based on the requirements for a compliance monitoring program under § 264.99 and must be as effective as that program --in determining compliance with the ground-water protection standard under § 264.92 and in determining the success of a corrective action program under paragraph (e) of this section, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>(e) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the owner or operator must conduct a corrective action program to remove or treat in place any hazardous constituents under § 264.93 that exceed concentration limits under § 264.94 in groundwater:</P>
        <P>(1) Between the compliance point under § 264.95 and the downgradient property boundary; and</P>
        <P>(2) Beyond the facility boundary, where necessary to protect human health and the environment, unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Regional Administrator that, despite the owner's or operator's best efforts, the owner or operator was unable to obtain the necessary permission to undertake such action. The owner/operator is not relieved of all responsibility to clean up a release that has migrated beyond the facility boundary where off-site access is denied. On-site measures to address such releases will be determined on a case-by-case basis.</P>
        <P>(3) Corrective action measures under this paragraph must be initiated and completed within a reasonable period of time considering the extent of contamination.</P>
        <P>(4) Corrective action measures under this paragraph may be terminated once the concentration of hazardous constituents under § 264.93 is reduced to levels below their respective concentration limits under § 264.94.</P>
        <P>(f) The owner or operator must continue corrective action measures during the compliance period to the extent necessary to ensure that the ground-water protection standard is not exceeded. If the owner or operator is conducting corrective action at the end of the compliance period, he must continue that corrective action for as long as necessary to achieve compliance with the ground-water protection standard. The owner or operator may terminate corrective action measures taken beyond the period equal to the active life of the waste management area (including the closure period) if he can demonstrate, based on data from the ground-water monitoring program under paragraph (d) of this section, that the ground-water protection standard of § 264.92 has not been exceeded for a period of three consecutive years.</P>
        <P>(g) The owner or operator must report in writing to the Regional Administrator on the effectiveness of the corrective action program. The owner or operator must submit these reports annually.</P>
        <P>(h) If the owner or operator determines that the corrective action program no longer satisfies the requirements of this section, he must, within 90 days, submit an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the program.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Written plan.</E> (1) The owner or operator of a hazardous waste management facility must have a written closure plan. In addition, certain surface impoundments and waste piles from which the owner or operator intends to remove or decontaminate the hazardous waste at partial or final closure are required by §§ 264.228(c)(1)(i) and 264.258(c)(1)(i) to have contingent closure plans. The plan must be submitted with the permit application, in accordance with § 270.14(b)(13) of this chapter, and approved by the Regional Administrator as part of the permit issuance procedures under part 124 of this chapter. In accordance with § 270.32 of this chapter, the approved closure plan will become a condition of any RCRA permit.</P>
        <P>(2) The Director's approval of the plan must ensure that the approved closure plan is consistent with §§ 264.111 through 264.115 and the applicable requirements of subpart F of this part, §§ 264.178, 264.197, 264.228, 264.258, 264.280, 264.310, 264.351, 264.601, and 264.1102. Until final closure is completed and certified in accordance with § 264.115, a copy of the approved plan and all approved revisions must be furnished to the Director upon request, including requests by mail.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Content of plan.</E> The plan must identify steps necessary to perform partial and/or final closure of the facility at any point during its active life. The closure plan must include, at least:</P>
        <P>(1) A description of how each hazardous waste management unit at the facility will be closed in accordance with § 264.111;</P>
        <P>(2) A description of how final closure of the facility will be conducted in accordance with § 264.111. The description must identify the maximum extent of the operations which will be unclosed during the active life of the facility; and</P>
        <P>(3) An estimate of the maximum inventory of hazardous wastes ever on-site over the active life of the facility and a detailed description of the methods to be used during partial closures and final closure, including, but not limited to, methods for removing, transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of all hazardous wastes, and identification of the type(s) of the off-site hazardous waste management units to be used, if applicable; and</P>
        <P>(4) A detailed description of the steps needed to remove or decontaminate all hazardous waste residues and contaminated containment system components, equipment, structures, and soils during partial and final closure, including, but not limited to, procedures for cleaning equipment and removing contaminated soils, methods for sampling and testing surrounding soils, and criteria for determining the extent of decontamination required to satisfy the closure performance standard; and</P>
        <P>(5) A detailed description of other activities necessary during the closure period to ensure that all partial closures and final closure satisfy the closure performance standards, including, but not limited to, ground-water monitoring, leachate collection, and run-on and run-off control; and</P>
        <P>(6) A schedule for closure of each hazardous waste management unit and for final closure of the facility. The schedule must include, at a minimum, the total time required to close each hazardous waste management unit and the time required for intervening closure activities which will allow tracking of the progress of partial and final closure. (For example, in the case of a landfill unit, estimates of the time required to treat or dispose of all hazardous waste inventory and of the time required to place a final cover must be included.)</P>
        <P>(7) For facilities that use trust funds to establish financial assurance under § 264.143 or § 264.145 and that are expected to close prior to the expiration of the permit, an estimate of the expected year of final closure.</P>

        <P>(8) For facilities where the Regional Administrator has applied alternative requirements at a regulated unit under §§ 264.90(f), 264.110(c), and/or § 264.140(d), either the alternative requirements applying to the regulated unit, or a reference to the enforceable document containing those alternative requirements.<PRTPAGE P="457"/>
        </P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendment of plan.</E> The owner or operator must submit a written notification of or request for a permit modification to authorize a change in operating plans, facility design, or the approved closure plan in accordance with the applicable procedures in parts 124 and 270. The written notification or request must include a copy of the amended closure plan for review or approval by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(1) The owner or operator may submit a written notification or request to the Regional Administrator for a permit modification to amend the closure plan at any time prior to the notification of partial or final closure of the facility.</P>
        <P>(2) The owner or operator must submit a written notification of or request for a permit modification to authorize a change in the approved closure plan whenever:</P>
        <P>(i) Changes in operating plans or facility design affect the closure plan, or</P>
        <P>(ii) There is a change in the expected year of closure, if applicable, or</P>
        <P>(iii) In conducting partial or final closure activities, unexpected events require a modification of the approved closure plan.</P>
        <P>(iv) The owner or operator requests the Regional Administrator to apply alternative requirements to a regulated unit under §§ 264.90(f), 264.110(c), and/or § 264.140(d).</P>
        <P>(3) The owner or operator must submit a written request for a permit modification including a copy of the amended closure plan for approval at least 60 days prior to the proposed change in facility design or operation, or no later than 60 days after an unexpected event has occurred which has affected the closure plan. If an unexpected event occurs during the partial or final closure period, the owner or operator must request a permit modification no later than 30 days after the unexpected event. An owner or operator of a surface impoundment or waste pile that intends to remove all hazardous waste at closure and is not otherwise required to prepare a contingent closure plan under § 264.228(c)(1)(i) or § 264.258(c)(1)(i), must submit an amended closure plan to the Regional Administrator no later than 60 days from the date that the owner or operator or Regional Administrator determines that the hazardous waste management unit must be closed as a landfill, subject to the requirements of § 264.310, or no later than 30 days from that date if the determination is made during partial or final closure. The Regional Administrator will approve, disapprove, or modify this amended plan in accordance with the procedures in parts 124 and 270. In accordance with § 270.32 of this chapter, the approved closure plan will become a condition of any RCRA permit issued.</P>
        <P>(4) The Regional Administrator may request modifications to the plan under the conditions described in § 264.112(c)(2). The owner or operator must submit the modified plan within 60 days of the Regional Administrator's request, or within 30 days if the change in facility conditions occurs during partial or final closure. Any modifications requested by the Regional Administrator will be approved in accordance with the procedures in parts 124 and 270.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification of partial closure and final closure.</E> (1) The owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator in writing at least 60 days prior to the date on which he expects to begin closure of a surface impoundment, waste pile, land treatment or landfill unit, or final closure of a facility with such a unit. The owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator in writing at least 45 days prior to the date on which he expects to begin final closure of a facility with only treatment or storage tanks, container storage, or incinerator units to be closed. The owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator in writing at least 45 days prior to the date on which he expects to begin partial or final closure of a boiler or industrial furnace, whichever is earlier.</P>
        <P>(2) The date when he “expects to begin closure” must be either:</P>

        <P>(i) No later than 30 days after the date on which any hazardous waste management unit receives the known final volume of hazardous wastes, or if there is a reasonable possibility that the hazardous waste management unit will receive additional hazardous wastes, no later than one year after the date on which the unit received the <PRTPAGE P="458"/>most recent volume of hazardous wastes. If the owner or operator of a hazardous waste management unit can demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that the hazardous waste management unit or facility has the capacity to receive additional hazardous wastes and he has taken all steps to prevent threats to human health and the environment, including compliance with all applicable permit requirements, the Regional Administrator may approve an extension to this one-year limit; or</P>
        <P>(ii) For units meeting the requirements of § 264.113(d), no later than 30 days after the date on which the hazardous waste management unit receives the known final volume of non-hazardous wastes, or if there is a reasonable possibility that the hazardous waste management unit will receive additional non-hazardous wastes, no later than one year after the date on which the unit received the most recent volume of non-hazardous wastes. If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that the hazardous waste management unit has the capacity to receive additional non-hazardous wastes and he has taken, and will continue to take, all steps to prevent threats to human health and the environment, including compliance with all applicable permit requirements, the Regional Administrator may approve an extension to this one-year limit.</P>
        <P>(3) If the facility's permit is terminated, or if the facility is otherwise ordered, by judicial decree or final order under section 3008 of RCRA, to cease receiving hazardous wastes or to close, then the requirements of this paragraph do not apply. However, the owner or operator must close the facility in accordance with the deadlines established in § 264.113.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Removal of wastes and decontamination or dismantling of equipment.</E> Nothing in this section shall preclude the owner or operator from removing hazardous wastes and decontaminating or dismantling equipment in accordance with the approved partial or final closure plan at any time before or after notification of partial or final closure.</P>

        <P>(e) In addition to the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section, an owner or operator of a hazardous waste surface impoundment that is not in compliance with the liner and leachate collection system requirements in 42 U.S.C. 3004(o)(1) and 3005(j)(1) or 42 U.S.C. 3004(o) (2) or (3) or 3005(j) (2), (3), (4) or (13) must:</P>
        <P>(1) Submit with the request to modify the permit:</P>
        <P>(i) A contingent corrective measures plan, unless a corrective action plan has already been submitted under § 264.99; and</P>
        <P>(ii) A plan for removing hazardous wastes in compliance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and</P>
        <P>(2) Remove all hazardous wastes from the unit by removing all hazardous liquids, and removing all hazardous sludges to the extent practicable without impairing the integrity of the liner(s), if any.</P>
        <P>(3) Removal of hazardous wastes must be completed no later than 90 days after the final receipt of hazardous wastes. The Regional Administrator may approve an extension to this deadline if the owner or operator demonstrates that the removal of hazardous wastes will, of necessity, take longer than the allotted period to complete and that an extension will not pose a threat to human health and the environment.</P>
        <P>(4) If a release that is a statistically significant increase (or decrease in the case of pH) over background values for detection monitoring parameters or constituents specified in the permit or that exceeds the facility's ground-water protection standard at the point of compliance, if applicable, is detected in accordance with the requirements in subpart F of this part, the owner or operator of the unit:</P>
        <P>(i) Must implement corrective measures in accordance with the approved contingent corrective measures plan required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section no later than one year after detection of the release, or approval of the contingent corrective measures plan, whichever is later;</P>
        <P>(ii) May continue to receive wastes at the unit following detection of the release only if the approved corrective measures plan includes a demonstration that continued receipt of wastes will not impede corrective action; and</P>
        <P>(iii) May be required by the Regional Administrator to implement corrective measures in less than one year or to cease the receipt of wastes until corrective measures have been implemented if necessary to protect human health and the environment.</P>
        <P>(5) During the period of corrective action, the owner or operator shall provide annual reports to the Regional Administrator describing the progress of the corrective action program, compile all ground-water monitoring data, and evaluate the effect of the continued receipt of non-hazardous wastes on the effectiveness of the corrective action.</P>

        <P>(i) Monitoring and reporting in accordance with the requirements of subparts F, K, L, M, N, and X of this part; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Maintenance and monitoring of waste containment systems in accordance with the requirements of subparts F, K, L, M, N, and X of this part.</P>
        <P>(2) Any time preceding partial closure of a hazardous waste management unit subject to post-closure care requirements or final closure, or any time during the post-closure period for a particular unit, the Regional Administrator may, in accordance with the permit modification procedures in parts 124 and 270:</P>
        <P>(i) Shorten the post-closure care period applicable to the hazardous waste management unit, or facility, if all disposal units have been closed, if he finds that the reduced period is sufficient to protect human health and the environment (e.g., leachate or ground-water monitoring results, characteristics of the hazardous wastes, application of advanced technology, or alternative disposal, treatment, or re-use techniques indicate that the hazardous waste management unit or facility is secure); or</P>
        <P>(ii) Extend the post-closure care period applicable to the hazardous waste management unit or facility if he finds that the extended period is necessary to protect human health and the environment (e.g., leachate or ground-water monitoring results indicate a potential for migration of hazardous wastes at levels which may be harmful to human health and the environment).</P>
        <P>(b) The Regional Administrator may require, at partial and final closure, continuation of any of the security requirements of § 264.14 during part or all of the post-closure period when:</P>
        <P>(1) Hazardous wastes may remain exposed after completion of partial or final closure; or</P>
        <P>(2) Access by the public or domestic livestock may pose a hazard to human health.</P>
        <P>(c) Post-closure use of property on or in which hazardous wastes remain after partial or final closure must never be allowed to disturb the integrity of the final cover, liner(s), or any other components of the containment system, or the function of the facility's monitoring systems, unless the Regional Administrator finds that the disturbance:</P>
        <P>(1) Is necessary to the proposed use of the property, and will not increase the potential hazard to human health or the environment; or</P>
        <P>(2) Is necessary to reduce a threat to human health or the environment.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Post-closure plan; amendment of plan.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Written Plan.</E> The owner or operator of a hazardous waste disposal unit must have a written post-closure plan. In addition, certain surface impoundments and waste piles from which the owner or operator intends to remove or decontaminate the hazardous wastes at partial or final closure are required by §§ 264.228(c)(1)(ii) and 264.258(c)(1)(ii) to have contingent post-closure plans. Owners or operators of surface impoundments and waste piles not otherwise required to prepare contingent post-closure plans under §§ 264.228(c)(1)(ii) and 264.258(c)(1)(ii) must submit a post-closure plan to the Regional Administrator within 90 days from the date that the owner or operator or Regional administrator determines that the hazardous waste management unit must be closed as a landfill, subject to the requirements of §§ 264.117 through 264.120. The plan must be submitted with the permit application, in accordance with § 270.14(b)(13) of this chapter, and approved by the Regional Administrator as part of the permit issuance procedures under part 124 of this chapter. In accordance with § 270.32 of this chapter, the approved post-closure plan will become a condition of any RCRA permit issued.</P>
        <P>(b) For each hazardous waste management unit subject to the requirements of this section, the post-closure plan must identify the activities that will be carried on after closure of each disposal unit and the frequency of these activities, and include at least:</P>

        <P>(1) A description of the planned monitoring activities and frequencies at <PRTPAGE P="463"/>which they will be performed to comply with subparts F, K, L, M, N, and X of this part during the post-closure care period; and</P>
        <P>(2) A description of the planned maintenance activities, and frequencies at which they will be performed, to ensure:</P>
        <P>(i) The integrity of the cap and final cover or other containment systems in accordance with the requirements of subparts F, K, L, M, N, and X of this part; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The function of the monitoring equipment in accordance with the requirements of subparts, F, K, L, M, N, and X of this part; and</P>
        <P>(3) The name, address, and phone number of the person or office to contact about the hazardous waste disposal unit or facility during the post-closure care period.</P>
        <P>(4) For facilities where the Regional Administrator has applied alternative requirements at a regulated unit under §§ 264.90(f), 264.110(c), and/or §§ 264.140(d), either the alternative requirements that apply to the regulated unit, or a reference to the enforceable document containing those requirements.</P>
        <P>(c) Until final closure of the facility, a copy of the approved post-closure plan must be furnished to the Regional Administrator upon request, including request by mail. After final closure has been certified, the person or office specified in § 264.118(b)(3) must keep the approved post-closure plan during the remainder of the post-closure period.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Amendment of plan.</E> The owner or operator must submit a written notification of or request for a permit modification to authorize a change in the approved post-closure plan in accordance with the applicable requirements in parts 124 and 270. The written notification or request must include a copy of the amended post-closure plan for review or approval by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(1) The owner or operator may submit a written notification or request to the Regional Administrator for a permit modification to amend the post-closure plan at any time during the active life of the facility or during the post-closure care period.</P>
        <P>(2) The owner or operator must submit a written notification of or request for a permit modification to authorize a change in the approved post-closure plan whenever:</P>
        <P>(i) Changes in operating plans or facility design affect the approved post-closure plan, or</P>
        <P>(ii) There is a change in the expected year of final closure, if applicable, or</P>
        <P>(iii) Events which occur during the active life of the facility, including partial and final closures, affect the approved post-closure plan.</P>
        <P>(iv) The owner or operator requests the Regional Administrator to apply alternative requirements to a regulated unit under §§ 264.90(f), 264.110(c), and/or § 264.140(d).</P>
        <P>(3) The owner or operator must submit a written request for a permit modification at least 60 days prior to the proposed change in facility design or operation, or no later than 60 days after an unexpected event has occurred which has affected the post-closure plan. An owner or operator of a surface impoundment or waste pile that intends to remove all hazardous waste at closure and is not otherwise required to submit a contingent post-closure plan under §§ 264.228(c)(1)(ii) and 264.258(c)(1)(ii) must submit a post-closure plan to the Regional Administrator no later than 90 days after the date that the owner or operator or Regional Administrator determines that the hazardous waste management unit must be closed as a landfill, subject to the requirements of § 264.310. The Regional Administrator will approve, disapprove or modify this plan in accordance with the procedures in parts 124 and 270. In accordance with § 270.32 of this chapter, the approved post-closure plan will become a permit condition.</P>

        <P>(4) The Regional Administrator may request modifications to the plan under the conditions described in § 264.118(d)(2). The owner or operator must submit the modified plan no later than 60 days after the Regional Administrator's request, or no later than 90 days if the unit is a surface impoundment or waste pile not previously required to prepare a contingent post-closure plan. Any modifications requested by the Regional Administrator <PRTPAGE P="464"/>will be approved, disapproved, or modified in accordance with the procedures in parts 124 and 270.</P>

        <P>(a) No later than 60 days after certification of closure of each hazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or operator must submit to the local zoning authority, or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use, and to the Regional Administrator a record of the type, location, and quantity of hazardous wastes disposed of within each cell or other disposal unit of the facility. For hazardous wastes disposed of before January 12, 1981, the owner or operator must identify the type, location, and quantity of the hazardous wastes to the best of his knowledge and in accordance with any records he has kept.</P>
        <P>(b) Within 60 days of certification of closure of the first hazardous waste disposal unit and within 60 days of certification of closure of the last hazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or operator must:</P>
        <P>(1) Record, in accordance with State law, a notation on the deed to the facility property—or on some other instrument which is normally examined during title search—that will in perpetuity notify any potential purchaser of the property that:</P>
        <P>(i) The land has been used to manage hazardous wastes; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Its use is restricted under 40 CFR part 264, subpart G regulations; and</P>
        <P>(iii) The survey plat and record of the type, location, and quantity of hazardous wastes disposed of within each cell or other hazardous waste disposal unit of the facility required by §§ 264.116 and 264.119(a) have been filed with the local zoning authority or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use and with the Regional Administrator; and</P>
        <P>(2) Submit a certification, signed by the owner or operator, that he has recorded the notation specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, including a copy of the document in which the notation has been placed, to the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(c) If the owner or operator or any subsequent owner or operator of the land upon which a hazardous waste disposal unit is located wishes to remove hazardous wastes and hazardous waste residues, the liner, if any, or contaminated soils, he must request a modification to the post-closure permit in accordance with the applicable requirements in parts 124 and 270. The owner or operator must demonstrate that the removal of hazardous wastes will satisfy the criteria of § 264.117(c). By removing hazardous waste, the owner or operator may become a generator of hazardous waste and must manage it in accordance with all applicable requirements of this chapter. If he is granted a permit modification or otherwise granted approval to conduct such removal activities, the owner or operator may request that the Regional Administrator approve either:</P>
        <P>(1) The removal of the notation on the deed to the facility property or other instrument normally examined during title search; or</P>
        <P>(2) The addition of a notation to the deed or instrument indicating the removal of the hazardous waste.</P>

The owner or operator may use costs for on-site disposal if he can demonstrate that on-site disposal capacity will exist at all times over the life of the facility.</P>
        <P>(3) The closure cost estimate may not incorporate any salvage value that may be realized with the sale of hazardous wastes, or non-hazardous wastes if applicable under § 264.113(d), facility structures or equipment, land, or other assets associated with the facility at the time of partial or final closure.</P>
        <P>(4) The owner or operator may not incorporate a zero cost for hazardous wastes, or non-hazardous wastes if applicable under § 264.113(d), that might have economic value.</P>

        <P>(b) During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must adjust the closure cost estimate for inflation within 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the establishment of the financial instrument(s) used to comply with § 264.143. For owners and operators using the financial test or corporate guarantee, the closure cost estimate <PRTPAGE P="467"/>must be updated for inflation within 30 days after the close of the firm's fiscal year and before submission of updated information to the Regional Administrator as specified in § 264.143(f)(3). --The adjustment may be made by recalculating the maximum costs of closure in current dollars, or by using an inflation factor derived from the most recent Implicit Price Deflator for Gross National Product published by the U.S. Department of Commerce in its <E T="03">Survey of Current Business,</E> as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. The inflation factor is the result of dividing the latest published annual Deflator by the Deflator for the previous year.</P>
        <P>(1) The first adjustment is made by multiplying the closure cost estimate by the inflation factor. The result is the adjusted closure cost estimate.</P>
        <P>(2) Subsequent adjustments are made by multiplying the latest adjusted closure cost estimate by the latest inflation factor.</P>
        <P>(c) During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must revise the closure cost estimate no later than 30 days after the Regional Administrator has approved the request to modify the closure plan, if the change in the closure plan increases the cost of closure. The revised closure cost estimate must be adjusted for inflation as specified in § 264.142(b).</P>
        <P>(d) The owner or operator must keep the following at the facility during the operating life of the facility: The latest closure cost estimate prepared in accordance with § 264.142 (a) and (c) and, when this estimate has been adjusted in accordance with § 264.142(b), the latest adjusted closure cost estimate.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Financial assurance for closure.</SUBJECT>
        <P>An owner or operator of each facility must establish financial assurance for closure of the facility. He must choose from the options as specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</P>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Closure trust fund.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing a closure trust fund which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal. The trustee must be an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</P>
        <P>(2) The wording of the trust agreement must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(a)(1), and the trust agreement must be accompanied by a formal certification of acknowledgment (for example, see § 264.151(a)(2)). Schedule A of the trust agreement must be updated within 60 days after a change in the amount of the current closure cost estimate covered by the agreement.</P>
        <P>(3) Payments into the trust fund must be made annually by the owner or operator over the term of the initial RCRA permit or over the remaining operating life of the facility as estimated in the closure plan, whichever period is shorter; this period is hereafter referred to as the “pay-in period.” The payments into the closure trust fund must be made as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) For a new facility, the first payment must be made before the initial receipt of hazardous waste for treatment, storage, or disposal. A receipt from the trustee for this payment must be submitted by the owner or operator to the Regional Administrator before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The first payment must be at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, except as provided in § 264.143(g), divided by the number of years in the pay-in period. Subsequent payments must be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment. The amount of each subsequent payment must be determined by this formula:</P>

        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>(ii) If an owner or operator establishes a trust fund as specified in § 265.143(a) of this chapter, and the value of that trust fund is less than the current closure cost estimate when a permit is awarded for the facility, the amount of the current closure cost estimate still to be paid into the trust fund must be paid in over the pay-in period as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Payments must continue to be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment made pursuant to part 265 of this chapter. The amount of each payment must be determined by this formula:</P>

        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>(4) The owner or operator may accelerate payments into the trust fund or he may deposit the full amount of the current closure cost estimate at the time the fund is established. However, he must maintain the value of the fund at no less than the value that the fund would have if annual payments were made as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(5) If the owner or operator establishes a closure trust fund after having used one or more alternate mechanisms specified in this section or in § 265.143 of this chapter, his first payment must be in at least the amount that the fund would contain if the trust fund were established initially and annual payments made according to specifications of this paragraph and § 265.143(a) of this chapter, as applicable.</P>
        <P>(6) After the pay-in period is completed, whenever the current closure cost estimate changes, the owner or operator must compare the new estimate with the trustee's most recent annual valuation of the trust fund. If the value of the fund is less than the amount of the new estimate, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the change in the cost estimate, must either deposit an amount into the fund so that its value after this deposit at least equals the amount of the current closure cost estimate, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the difference.</P>
        <P>(7) If the value of the trust fund is greater than the total amount of the current closure cost estimate, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the Regional Administrator for release of the amount in excess of the current closure cost estimate.</P>
        <P>(8) If an owner or operator substitutes other financial assurance as specified in this section for all or part of the trust fund, he may submit a written request to the Regional Administrator for release of the amount in excess of the current closure cost estimate covered by the trust fund.</P>
        <P>(9) Within 60 days after receiving a request from the owner or operator for release of funds as specified in paragraph (a) (7) or (8) of this section, the Regional Administrator will instruct the trustee to release to the owner or operator such funds as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing.</P>

        <P>(10) After beginning partial or final closure, an owner or operator or another person authorized to conduct partial or final closure may request reimbursements for partial or final closure expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the Regional Administrator. The owner or operator may request reimbursements for partial closure only if sufficient funds are remaining in the trust fund to cover the maximum costs of closing the facility over its remaining operating life. Within 60 days after receiving bills for partial or final closure activities, the Regional Administrator will instruct the trustee to make reimbursements in those amounts as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing, if the Regional Administrator determines that the partial or final closure expenditures are in accordance with the approved closure plan, or otherwise justified. If the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that the maximum cost of closure over the remaining life of the facility will be significantly greater than the value of the trust <PRTPAGE P="469"/>fund, he may withhold reimbursements of such amounts as he deems prudent until he determines, in accordance with § 264.143(i) that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility. If the Regional Administrator does not instruct the trustee to make such reimbursements, he will provide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of reasons.</P>
        <P>(11) The Regional Administrator will agree to termination of the trust when:</P>
        <P>(i) An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.143(i).</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Surety bond guaranteeing payment into a closure trust fund.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining a surety bond which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the bond to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the bond to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal. The bond must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</P>
        <P>(2) The wording of the surety bond must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(b).</P>
        <P>(3) The owner or operator who uses a surety bond to satisfy the requirements of this section must also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the bond, all payments made thereunder will be deposited by the surety directly into the standby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the Regional Administrator. This standby trust fund must meet the requirements specified in § 264.143(a), except that:</P>
        <P>(i) An originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the Regional Administrator with the surety bond; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Until the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this section, the following are not required by these regulations:</P>
        <P>(A) Payments into the trust fund as specified in § 264.143(a);</P>
        <P>(B) Updating of Schedule A of the trust agreement (see § 264.151(a)) to show current closure cost estimates;</P>
        <P>(C) Annual valuations as required by the trust agreement; and</P>
        <P>(D) Notices of nonpayment as required by the trust agreement.</P>
        <P>(4) The bond must guarantee that the owner or operator will:</P>
        <P>(i) Fund the standby trust fund in an amount equal to the penal sum of the bond before the beginning of final closure of the facility; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Fund the standby trust fund in an amount equal to the penal sum within 15 days after an administrative order to begin final closure issued by the Regional Administrator becomes final, or within 15 days after an order to begin final closure is issued by a U.S. district court or other court of competent jurisdiction; or</P>
        <P>(iii) Provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section, and obtain the Regional Administrator's written approval of the assurance provided, within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice of cancellation of the bond from the surety.</P>
        <P>(5) Under the terms of the bond, the surety will become liable on the bond obligation when the owner or operator fails to perform as guaranteed by the bond.</P>
        <P>(6) The penal sum of the bond must be in an amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, except as provided in § 264.143(g).</P>

        <P>(7) Whenever the current closure cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the penal sum, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the penal sum to be increased to an amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the increase. Whenever the current closure cost estimate decreases, <PRTPAGE P="470"/>the penal sum may be reduced to the amount of the current closure cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(8) Under the terms of the bond, the surety may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the - Regional Administrator. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, as evidenced by the return receipts.</P>
        <P>(9) The owner or operator may cancel the bond if the Regional Administrator has given prior written consent based on his receipt of evidence of alternate financial assurance as specified in this section.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Surety bond guaranteeing performance of closure.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining a surety bond which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the bond to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the bond to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal. The bond must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</P>
        <P>(2) The wording of the surety bond must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(c).</P>
        <P>(3) The owner or operator who uses a surety bond to satisfy the requirements of this section must also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the bond, all payments made thereunder will be deposited by the surety directly into the standby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the Regional Administrator. This standby trust must meet the requirements specified in § 264.143(a), except that:</P>
        <P>(i) An originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the Regional Administrator with the surety bond; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Unless the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this section, the following are not required by these regulations:</P>
        <P>(A) Payments into the trust fund as specified in § 264.143(a);</P>
        <P>(B) Updating of Schedule A of the trust agreement (see § 264.151(a)) to show current closure cost estimates;</P>
        <P>(C) Annual valuations as required by the trust agreement; and</P>
        <P>(D) Notices of nonpayment as required by the trust agreement.</P>
        <P>(4) The bond must guarantee that the owner or operator will:</P>
        <P>(i) Perform final closure in accordance with the closure plan and other requirements of the permit for the facility whenever required to do so; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section, and obtain the Regional Administrator's written approval of the assurance provided, within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice of cancellation of the bond from the surety.</P>
        <P>(5) Under the terms of the bond, the surety will become liable on the bond obligation when the owner or operator fails to perform as guaranteed by the bond. Following a final administrative determination pursuant to section 3008 of RCRA that the owner or operator has failed to perform final closure in accordance with the approved closure plan and other permit requirements when required to do so, under the terms of the bond the surety will perform final closure as guaranteed by the bond or will deposit the amount of the penal sum into the standby trust fund.</P>
        <P>(6) The penal sum of the bond must be in an amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate.</P>

        <P>(7) Whenever the current closure cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the penal sum, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the penal sum to be increased to an amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section. Whenever the current closure cost estimate <PRTPAGE P="471"/>decreases, the penal sum may be reduced to the amount of the current closure cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(8) Under the terms of the bond, the surety may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the Regional Administrator. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, as evidenced by the return receipts.</P>
        <P>(9) The owner or operator may cancel the bond if the Regional Administrator has given prior written consent. The Regional Administrator will provide such written consent when:</P>
        <P>(i) An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.143(i).</P>
        <P>(10) The surety will not be liable for deficiencies in the performance of closure by the owner or operator after the Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.143(i).</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Closure letter of credit.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining an irrevocable standby letter of credit which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the letter to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the letter of credit to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal. The letter of credit must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The issuing institution must be an entity which has the authority to issue letters of credit and whose letter-of-credit operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</P>
        <P>(2) The wording of the letter of credit must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(d).</P>
        <P>(3) An owner or operator who uses a letter of credit to satisfy the requirements of this section must also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the letter of credit, all amounts paid pursuant to a draft by the Regional Administrator will be deposited by the issuing institution directly into the standby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the Regional Administrator. This standby trust fund must meet the requirements of the trust fund specified in § 264.143(a), except that:</P>
        <P>(i) An originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the Regional Administrator with the letter of credit; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Unless the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this section, the following are not required by these regulations:</P>
        <P>(A) Payments into the trust fund as specified in § 264.143(a);</P>
        <P>(B) Updating of Schedule A of the trust agreement (see § 264.151(a)) to show current closure cost estimates;</P>
        <P>(C) Annual valuations as required by the trust agreement; and</P>
        <P>(D) Notices of nonpayment as required by the trust agreement.</P>
        <P>(4) The letter of credit must be accompanied by a letter from the owner or operator referring to the letter of credit by number, issuing institution, and date, and providing the following information: the EPA Identification Number, name, and address of the facility, and the amount of funds assured for closure of the facility by the letter of credit.</P>

        <P>(5) The letter of credit must be irrevocable and issued for a period of at least 1 year. The letter of credit must provide that the expiration date will be automatically extended for a period of at least 1 year unless, at least 120 days before the current expiration date, the issuing institution notifies both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator by certified mail of a decision not to extend the expiration date. Under the terms of the letter of credit, the 120 days will begin on the date when both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator have received the notice, as evidenced by the return receipts.<PRTPAGE P="472"/>
        </P>
        <P>(6) The letter of credit must be issued in an amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, except as provided in § 264.143(g).</P>
        <P>(7) Whenever the current closure cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the amount of the credit, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the amount of the credit to be increased so that it at least equals the current closure cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the increase. Whenever the current closure cost estimate decreases, the amount of the credit may be reduced to the amount of the current closure cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(8) Following a final administrative determination pursuant to section 3008 of RCRA that the owner or operator has failed to perform final closure in accordance with the closure plan and other permit requirements when required to do so, the Regional Administrator may draw on the letter of credit.</P>
        <P>(9) If the owner or operator does not establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section and obtain written approval of such alternate assurance from the Regional Administrator within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice from issuing institution that it has decided not to extend the letter of credit beyond the current expiration date, the Regional Administrator will draw on the letter of credit. The Regional Administrator may delay the drawing if the issuing institution grants an extension of the term of the credit. During the last 30 days of any such extension the Regional Administrator will draw on the letter of credit if the owner or operator has failed to provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section and obtain written approval of such assurance from the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(10) The Regional Administrator will return the letter of credit to the issuing institution for termination when:</P>
        <P>(i) An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.143(i).</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Closure insurance.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining closure insurance which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting a certificate of such insurance to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the certificate of insurance to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal. The insurance must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. At a minimum, the insurer must be licensed to transact the business of insurance, or eligible to provide insurance as an excess or surplus lines insurer, in one or more States.</P>
        <P>(2) The wording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(e).</P>
        <P>(3) The closure insurance policy must be issued for a face amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, except as provided in § 264.143(g). The term “face amount” means the total amount the insurer is obligated to pay under the policy. Actual payments by the insurer will not change the face amount, although the insurer's future liability will be lowered by the amount of the payments.</P>
        <P>(4) The closure insurance policy must guarantee that funds will be available to close the facility whenever final closure occurs. The policy must also guarantee that once final closure begins, the insurer will be responsible for paying out funds, up to an amount equal to the face amount of the policy, upon the direction of the Regional Administrator, to such party or parties as the Regional Administrator specifies.</P>

        <P>(5) After beginning partial or final closure, an owner or operator or any other person authorized to conduct closure may request reimbursements for closure expenditures by submitting <PRTPAGE P="473"/>itemized bills to the Regional Administrator. The owner or operator may request reimbursements for partial closure only if the remaining value of the policy is sufficient to cover the maximum costs of closing the facility over its remaining operating life. Within 60 days after receiving bills for closure activities, the Regional Administrator will instruct the insurer to make reimbursements in such amounts as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing, if the Regional Administrator determines that the partial or final closure expenditures are in accordance with the approved closure plan or otherwise justified. If the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that the maximum cost of closure over the remaining life of the facility will be significantly greater than the face amount of the policy, he may withhold reimbursements of such amounts as he deems prudent until he determines, in accordance with § 264.143(i), that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility. If the Regional Administrator does not instruct the insurer to make such reimbursements, he will provide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of reasons.</P>
        <P>(6) The owner or operator must maintain the policy in full force and effect until the Regional Administrator consents to termination of the policy by the owner or operator as specified in paragraph (e)(10) of this section. Failure to pay the premium, without substitution of alternate financial assurance as specified in this section, will constitute a significant violation of these regulations, warranting such remedy as the Regional Administrator deems necessary. Such violation will be deemed to begin upon receipt by the Regional Administrator of a notice of future cancellation, termination, or failure to renew due to nonpayment of the premium, rather than upon the date of expiration.</P>
        <P>(7) Each policy must contain a provision allowing assignment of the policy to a successor owner or operator. Such assignment may be conditional upon consent of the insurer, provided such consent is not unreasonably refused.</P>
        <P>(8) The policy must provide that the insurer may not cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy except for failure to pay the premium. The automatic renewal of the policy must, at a minimum, provide the insured with the option of renewal at the face amount of the expiring policy. If there is a failure to pay the premium, the insurer may elect to cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy by sending notice by certified mail to the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning with the date of receipt of the notice by both the Regional Administrator and the owner or operator, as evidenced by the return receipts. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew may not occur and the policy will remain in full force and effect in the event that on or before the date of expiration:</P>
        <P>(i) The Regional Administrator deems the facility abandoned; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The permit is terminated or revoked or a new permit is denied; or</P>
        <P>(iii) Closure is ordered by the Regional Administrator or a U.S. district court or other court of competent jurisdiction; or</P>
        <P>(iv) The owner or operator is named as debtor in a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code; or</P>
        <P>(v) The premium due is paid.</P>
        <P>(9) Whenever the current closure cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the face amount of the policy, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the face amount to be increased to an amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the increase. Whenever the current closure cost estimate decreases, the face amount may be reduced to the amount of the current closure cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</P>

        <P>(10) The Regional Administrator will give written consent to the owner or operator that he may terminate the insurance policy when:<PRTPAGE P="474"/>
        </P>

        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.143(i).</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Financial test and corporate guarantee for closure.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by demonstrating that he passes a financial test as specified in this paragraph. To pass this test the owner or operator must meet the criteria of either paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section:</P>
        <P>(i) The owner or operator must have:</P>
        <P>(A) Two of the following three ratios: a ratio of total liabilities to net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization to total liabilities greater than 0.1; and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities greater than 1.5; and</P>
        <P>(B) Net working capital and tangible net worth each at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates; and</P>
        <P>(C) Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and</P>
        <P>(D) Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of total assets or at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates.</P>
        <P>(ii) The owner or operator must have:</P>
        <P>(A) A current rating for his most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's or Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa as issued by Moody's; and</P>
        <P>(B) Tangible net worth at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates; and</P>

        <P>(D) Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of total assets or at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates.</P>
        <P>(2) The phrase “current closure and post-closure cost estimates” as used in paragraph (f)(1) of this section refers to the cost estimates required to be shown in paragraphs 1-4 of the letter from the owner's or operator's chief financial officer (§ 264.151(f)). The phrase “current plugging and abandonment cost estimates” as used in paragraph (f)(1) of this section refers to the cost estimates required to be shown in paragraphs 1-4 of the letter from the owner's or operator's chief financial officer (§ 144.70(f) of this title).</P>
        <P>(3) To demonstrate that he meets this test, the owner or operator must submit the following items to the Regional Administrator:</P>
        <P>(i) A letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as specified in § 264.151(f); and</P>
        <P>(ii) A copy of the independent certified public accountant's report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year; and</P>
        <P>(iii) A special report from the owner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator stating that:</P>
        <P>(A) He has compared the data which the letter from the chief financial officer specifies as having been derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements; and</P>
        <P>(B) In connection with that procedure, no matters came to his attention which caused him to believe that the specified data should be adjusted.</P>
        <P>(4) An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal.</P>

        <P>(5) After the initial submission of items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the owner or operator must send updated information to the Regional Administrator within 90 days after the close of each succeeding fiscal year. This information must consist of all three items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="475"/>
        </P>
        <P>(6) If the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, he must send notice to the Regional Administrator of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section. The notice must be sent by certified mail within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements. The owner or operator must provide the alternate financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(7) The Regional Administrator may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, require reports of financial condition at any time from the owner or operator in addition to those specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If the Regional Administrator finds, on the basis of such reports or other information, that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section within 30 days after notification of such a finding.</P>
        <P>(8) The Regional Administrator may disallow use of this test on the basis of qualifications in the opinion expressed by the independent certified public accountant in his report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements (see paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section). An adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion will be cause for disallowance. The Regional Administrator will evaluate other qualifications on an individual basis. The owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section within 30 days after notification of the disallowance.</P>
        <P>(9) The owner or operator is no longer required to submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section when:</P>
        <P>(i) An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.143(i).</P>
        <P>(10) An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a written guarantee. The guarantor must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraphs (f)(1) through (8) of this section and must comply with the terms of the guarantee. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(h). The certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the items sent to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. One of these items must be the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, the letter must describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator, this letter must describe this “substantial business relationship” and the value received in consideration of the guarantee. The terms of the guarantee must provide that:</P>
        <P>(i) If the owner or operator fails to perform final closure of a facility covered by the corporate guarantee in accordance with the closure plan and other permit requirements whenever required to do so, the guarantor will do so or establish a trust fund as specified in § 264.143(a) in the name of the owner or operator.</P>
        <P>(ii) The corporate guarantee will remain in force unless the guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the Regional Administrator. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, as evidenced by the return receipts.</P>

        <P>(iii) If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section and obtain the written approval of such alternate <PRTPAGE P="476"/>assurance from the Regional Administrator within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice of cancellation of the corporate guarantee from the guarantor, the guarantor will provide such alternative financial assurance in the name of the owner or operator.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Use of multiple financial mechanisms.</E> An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing more than one financial mechanism per facility. These mechanisms are limited to trust funds, surety bonds guaranteeing payment into a trust fund, letters of credit, and insurance. The mechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e), respectively, of this section, except that it is the combination of mechanisms, rather than the single mechanism, which must provide financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund in combination with a surety bond or a letter of credit, he may use the trust fund as the standby trust fund for the other mechanisms. A single standby trust fund may be established for two or more mechanisms. The Regional Administrator may use any or all of the mechanisms to provide for closure of the facility.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Use of a financial mechanism for multiple facilities.</E> An owner or operator may use a financial assurance mechanism specified in this section to meet the requirements of this section for more than one facility. Evidence of financial assurance submitted to the Regional Administrator must include a list showing, for each facility, the EPA Identification Number, name, address, and the amount of funds for closure assured by the mechanism. If the facilities covered by the mechanism are in more than one Region, identical evidence of financial assurance must be submitted to and maintained with the Regional Administrators of all such Regions. The amount of funds available through the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that would be available if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained for each facility. In directing funds available through the mechanism for closure of any of the facilities covered by the mechanism, the Regional Administrator may direct only the amount of funds designated for that facility, unless the owner or operator agrees to the use of additional funds available under the mechanism.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Release of the owner or operator from the requirements of this section.</E> Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and a qualified Professional Engineer that final closure has been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan, the Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing that he is no longer required by this section to maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility, unless the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that final closure has not been in accordance with the approved closure plan. The Regional Administrator shall provide the owner or operator a detailed written statement of any such reason to believe that closure has not been in accordance with the approved closure plan.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Cost estimate for post-closure care.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) The owner or operator of a disposal surface impoundment, disposal miscellaneous unit, land treatment unit, or landfill unit, or of a surface impoundment or waste pile required under §§ 264.228 and 264.258 to prepare a contingent closure and post-closure plan, must have a detailed written estimate, in current dollars, of the annual cost of post-closure monitoring and maintenance of the facility in accordance with the applicable post-closure regulations in §§ 264.117 through 264.120, 264.228, 264.258, 264.280, 264.310, and 264.603.</P>

        <P>(1) The post-closure cost estimate must be based on the costs to the owner or operator of hiring a third party to conduct post-closure care activities. A third party is a party who is neither a parent nor a subsidiary of the owner or operator. (See definition of parent corporation in § 264.141(d).)<PRTPAGE P="477"/>
        </P>
        <P>(2) The post-closure cost estimate is calculated by multiplying the annual post-closure cost estimate by the number of years of post-closure care required under § 264.117.</P>

        <P>(b) During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must adjust the post-closure cost estimate for inflation within 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the establishment of the financial instrument(s) used to comply with § 264.145. For owners or operators using the financial test or corporate guarantee, the post-closure cost estimate must be updated for inflation within 30 days after the close of the firm's fiscal year and before the submission of updated information to the Regional Administrator as specified in § 264.145(f)(5). The adjustment may be made by recalculating the post-closure cost estimate in current dollars or by using an inflation factor derived from the most recent Implicit Price Deflator for Gross National Product published by the U.S. Department of Commerce in its <E T="03">Survey of Current Business</E> as specified in § 264.145(b)(1) and (2). The inflation factor is the result of dividing the latest published annual Deflator by the Deflator for the previous year.</P>
        <P>(1) The first adjustment is made by multiplying the post-closure cost estimate by the inflation factor. The result is the adjusted post-closure cost estimate.</P>
        <P>(2) Subsequent adjustments are made by multiplying the latest adjusted post-closure cost estimate by the latest inflation factor.</P>
        <P>(c) During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must revise the post-closure cost estimate within 30 days after the Regional Administrator has approved the request to modify the post-closure plan, if the change in the post-closure plan increases the cost of post-closure care. The revised post-closure cost estimate must be adjusted for inflation as specified in § 264.144(b).</P>
        <P>(d) The owner or operator must keep the following at the facility during the operating life of the facility: The latest post-closure cost estimate prepared in accordance with § 264.144 (a) and (c) and, when this estimate has been adjusted in accordance with § 264.144(b), the latest adjusted post-closure cost estimate.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Financial assurance for post-closure care.</SUBJECT>
        <P>The owner or operator of a hazardous waste management unit subject to the requirements of § 264.144 must establish financial assurance for post-closure care in accordance with the approved post-closure plan for the facility 60 days prior to the initial receipt of hazardous waste or the effective date of the regulation, whichever is later. He must choose from the following options:</P>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Post-closure trust fund.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing a post-closure trust fund which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for disposal. The trustee must be an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</P>
        <P>(2) The wording of the trust agreement must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(a)(1), and the trust agreement must be accompanied by a formal certification of acknowledgment (for example, see § 264.151(a)(2)). Schedule A of the trust agreement must be updated within 60 days after a change in the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate covered by the agreement.</P>

        <P>(3) Payments into the trust fund must be made annually by the owner or operator over the term of the initial RCRA permit or over the remaining operating life of the facility as estimated in the closure plan, whichever period is shorter; this period is hereafter referred to as the “pay-in period.” The <PRTPAGE P="478"/>payments into the post-closure trust fund must be made as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) For a new facility, the first payment must be made before the initial receipt of hazardous waste for disposal. A receipt from the trustee for this payment must be submitted by the owner or operator to the Regional Administrator before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The first payment must be at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate, except as provided in § 264.145(g), divided by the number of years in the pay-in period. Subsequent payments must be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment. The amount of each subsequent payment must be determined by this formula:</P>

        </MATH>
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP SOURCE="FP-2">where CE is the current post-closure cost estimate, CV is the current value of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in the pay-in period.</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>(ii) If an owner or operator establishes a trust fund as specified in § 265.145(a) of this chapter, and the value of that trust fund is less than the current post-closure cost estimate when a permit is awarded for the facility, the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate still to be paid into the fund must be paid in over the pay-in period as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Payments must continue to be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment made pursuant to Part 265 of this chapter. The amount of each payment must be determined by this formula:</P>
        <MATH DEEP="20" SPAN="1">
          <MID>EC01AU92.050</MID>
        </MATH>
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP SOURCE="FP-2">where CE is the current post-closure cost estimate, CV is the current value of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in the pay-in period.</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>(4) The owner or operator may accelerate payments into the trust fund or he may deposit the full amount of the current post-closure cost estimate at the time the fund is established. However, he must maintain the value of the fund at no less than the value that the fund would have if annual payments were made as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(5) If the owner or operator establishes a post-closure trust fund after having used one or more alternate mechanisms specified in this section or in § 265.145 of this chapter, his first payment must be in at least the amount that the fund would contain if the trust fund were established initially and annual payments made according to specifications of this paragraph and § 265.145(a) of this chapter, as applicable.</P>
        <P>(6) After the pay-in period is completed, whenever the current post-closure cost estimate changes during the operating life of the facility, the owner or operator must compare the new estimate with the trustee's most recent annual valuation of the trust fund. If the value of the fund is less than the amount of the new estimate, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the change in the cost estimate, must either deposit an amount into the fund so that its value after this deposit at least equals the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the difference.</P>
        <P>(7) During the operating life of the facility, if the value of the trust fund is greater than the total amount of the current post-closure cost estimate, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the Regional Administrator for release of the amount in excess of the current post-closure cost estimate.</P>
        <P>(8) If an owner or operator substitutes other financial assurance as specified in this section for all or part of the trust fund, he may submit a written request to the Regional Administrator for release of the amount in excess of the current post-closure cost estimate covered by the trust fund.</P>
        <P>(9) Within 60 days after receiving a request from the owner or operator for release of funds as specified in paragraph (a) (7) or (8) of this section, the Regional Administrator will instruct the trustee to release to the owner or operator such funds as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing.</P>

        <P>(10) During the period of post-closure care, the Regional Administrator may approve a release of funds if the owner <PRTPAGE P="479"/>or operator demonstrates to the Regional Administrator that the value of the trust fund exceeds the remaining cost of post-closure care.</P>
        <P>(11) An owner or operator or any other person authorized to conduct post-closure care may request reimbursements for post-closure care expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the Regional Administrator. Within 60 days after receiving bills for post-closure care activities, the Regional Administrator will instruct the trustee to make reimbursements in those amounts as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing, if the Regional Administrator determines that the post-closure care expenditures are in accordance with the approved post-closure plan or otherwise justified. If the Regional Administrator does not instruct the trustee to make such reimbursements, he will provide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of reasons.</P>
        <P>(12) The Regional Administrator will agree to termination of the trust when:</P>
        <P>(i) An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.145(i).</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Surety bond guaranteeing payment into a post-closure trust fund.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining a surety bond which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the bond to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the bond to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for disposal. The bond must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</P>
        <P>(2) The wording of the surety bond must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(b).</P>
        <P>(3) The owner or operator who uses a surety bond to satisfy the requirements of this section must also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the bond, all payments made thereunder will be deposited by the surety directly into the standby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the Regional Administrator. This standby trust fund must meet the requirements specified in § 264.145(a), except that:</P>
        <P>(i) An originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the Regional Administrator with the surety bond; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Until the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this section, the following are not required by these regulations:</P>
        <P>(A) Payments into the trust fund as specified in § 264.145(a);</P>
        <P>(B) Updating of Schedule A of the trust agreement (see § 264.151(a)) to show current post-closure cost estimates;</P>
        <P>(C) Annual valuations as required by the trust agreement; and</P>
        <P>(D) Notices of nonpayment as required by the trust agreement.</P>
        <P>(4) The bond must guarantee that the owner or operator will:</P>
        <P>(i) Fund the standby trust fund in an amount equal to the penal sum of the bond before the beginning of final closure of the facility; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Fund the standby trust fund in an amount equal to the penal sum within 15 days after an administrative order to begin final closure issued by the Regional Administrator becomes final, or within 15 days after an order to begin final closure is issued by a U.S. district court or other court of competent jurisdiction; or</P>
        <P>(iii) Provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section, and obtain the Regional Administrator's written approval of the assurance provided, within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice of cancellation of the bond from the surety.</P>
        <P>(5) Under the terms of the bond, the surety will become liable on the bond obligation when the owner or operator fails to perform as guaranteed by the bond.</P>

        <P>(6) The penal sum of the bond must be in an amount at least equal to the <PRTPAGE P="480"/>current post-closure cost estimate, except as provided in § 264.145(g).</P>
        <P>(7) Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the penal sum, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the penal sum to be increased to an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the increase. Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate decreases, the penal sum may be reduced to the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(8) Under the terms of the bond, the surety may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the -Regional Administrator. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, as evidenced by the return receipts.</P>
        <P>(9) The owner or operator may cancel the bond if the Regional Administrator has given prior written consent based on his receipt of evidence of alternate financial assurance as specified in this section.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Surety bond guaranteeing performance of post-closure care.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining a surety bond which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the bond to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the bond to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for disposal. The bond must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</P>
        <P>(2) The wording of the surety bond must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(c).</P>
        <P>(3) The owner or operator who uses a surety bond to satisfy the requirements of this section must also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the bond, all payments made thereunder will be deposited by the surety directly into the standby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the Regional Administrator. This standby trust fund must meet the requirements specified in § 264.145(a), except that:</P>
        <P>(i) An originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the Regional Administrator with the surety bond; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Unless the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this section, the following are not required by these regulations:</P>
        <P>(A) Payments into the trust fund as specified in § 264.145(a);</P>
        <P>(B) Updating of Schedule A of the trust agreement (see § 264.151(a)) to show current post-closure cost estimates;</P>

        <P>(i) Perform post-closure care in accordance with the post-closure plan and other requirements of the permit for the facility; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section, and obtain the Regional Administrator's written approval of the assurance provided, within 90 days of receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice of cancellation of the bond from the surety.</P>

        <P>(5) Under the terms of the bond, the surety will become liable on the bond obligation when the owner or operator fails to perform as guaranteed by the bond. Following a final administrative determination pursuant to section 3008 of RCRA that the owner or operator has failed to perform post-closure care in accordance with the approved post-closure plan and other permit requirements, under the terms of the bond the surety will perform post-closure care in accordance with the post-closure plan and other permit requirements or will <PRTPAGE P="481"/>deposit the amount of the penal sum into the standby trust fund.</P>
        <P>(6) The penal sum of the bond must be in an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate.</P>
        <P>(7) Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the penal sum during the operating life of the facility, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the penal sum to be increased to an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section. Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate decreases during the operating life of the facility, the penal sum may be reduced to the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(8) During the period of post-closure care, the Regional Administrator may approve a decrease in the penal sum if the owner or operator demonstrates to the Regional Administrator that the amount exceeds the remaining cost of post-closure care.</P>
        <P>(9) Under the terms of the bond, the surety may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the Regional Administrator. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, as evidenced by the return receipts.</P>
        <P>(10) The owner or operator may cancel the bond if the Regional Administrator has given prior written consent. The Regional Administrator will provide such written consent when:</P>
        <P>(i) An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.145(i).</P>
        <P>(11) The surety will not be liable for deficiencies in the performance of post-closure care by the owner or operator after the Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.145(i).</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Post-closure letter of credit.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining an irrevocable standby letter of credit which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the letter to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the letter of credit to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for disposal. The letter of credit must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The issuing institution must be an entity which has the authority to issue letters of credit and whose letter-of-credit operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</P>
        <P>(2) The wording of the letter of credit must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(d).</P>
        <P>(3) An owner or operator who uses a letter of credit to satisfy the requirements of this section must also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the letter of credit, all amounts paid pursuant to a draft by the Regional Administrator will be deposited by the issuing institution directly into the standby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the Regional Administrator. This standby trust fund must meet the requirements of the trust fund specified in § 264.145(a), except that:</P>
        <P>(i) An originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the Regional Administrator with the letter of credit; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Unless the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this section, the following are not required by these regulations:</P>
        <P>(A) Payments into the trust fund as specified in § 264.145(a);</P>
        <P>(B) Updating of Schedule A of the trust agreement (see § 264.151(a)) to show current post-closure cost estimates;</P>
        <P>(C) Annual valuations as required by the trust agreement; and</P>
        <P>(D) Notices of nonpayment as required by the trust agreement.</P>

        <P>(4) The letter of credit must be accompanied by a letter from the owner <PRTPAGE P="482"/>or operator referring to the letter of credit by number, issuing institution, and date, and providing the following information: the EPA Identification Number, name, and address of the facility, and the amount of funds assured for post-closure care of the facility by the letter of credit.</P>
        <P>(5) The letter of credit must be irrevocable and issued for a period of at least 1 year. The letter of credit must provide that the expiration date will be automatically extended for a period of at least 1 year unless, at least 120 days before the current expiration date, the issuing institution notifies both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator by certified mail of a decision not to extend the expiration date. Under the terms of the letter of credit, the 120 days will begin on the date when both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator have received the notice, as evidenced by the return receipts.</P>
        <P>(6) The letter of credit must be issued in an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate, except as provided in § 264.145(g).</P>
        <P>(7) Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the amount of the credit during the operating life of the facility, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the amount of the credit to be increased so that it at least equals the current post-closure cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the increase. Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate decreases during the operating life of the facility, the amount of the credit may be reduced to the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(8) During the period of post-closure care, the Regional Administrator may approve a decrease in the amount of the letter of credit if the owner or operator demonstrates to the Regional Administrator that the amount exceeds the remaining cost of post-closure care.</P>
        <P>(9) Following a final administrative determination pursuant to section 3008 of RCRA that the owner or operator has failed to perform post-closure care in accordance with the approved post-closure plan and other permit requirements, the Regional Administrator may draw on the letter of credit.</P>
        <P>(10) If the owner or operator does not establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section and obtain written approval of such alternate assurance from the Regional Administrator within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice from the issuing institution that it has decided not to extend the letter of credit beyond the current expiration date, the Regional Administrator will draw on the letter of credit. The Regional Administrator may delay the drawing if the issuing institution grants an extension of the term of the credit. During the last 30 days of any such extension the Regional Administrator will draw on the letter of credit if the owner or operator has failed to provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section and obtain written approval of such assurance from the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(11) The Regional Administrator will return the letter of credit to the issuing institution for termination when:</P>
        <P>(i) An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.145(i).</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Post-closure insurance.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining post-closure insurance which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting a certificate of such insurance to the Regional Administrator. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the certificate of insurance to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for disposal. The insurance must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. At a minimum, the insurer must be licensed to transact the business of insurance, or eligible to <PRTPAGE P="483"/>provide insurance as an excess or surplus lines insurer, in one or more States.</P>
        <P>(2) The wording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(e).</P>
        <P>(3) The post-closure insurance policy must be issued for a face amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate, except as provided in § 264.145(g). The term “face amount” means the total amount the insurer is obligated to pay under the policy. Actual payments by the insurer will not change the face amount, although the insurer's future liability will be lowered by the amount of the payments.</P>
        <P>(4) The post-closure insurance policy must guarantee that funds will be available to provide post-closure care of the facility whenever the post-closure period begins. The policy must also guarantee that once post-closure care begins, the insurer will be responsible for paying out funds, up to an amount equal to the face amount of the policy, upon the direction of the Regional Administrator, to such party or parties as the Regional Administrator specifies.</P>
        <P>(5) An owner or operator or any other person authorized to conduct post-closure care may request reimbursements for post-closure care expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the Regional Administrator. Within 60 days after receiving bills for post-closure care activities, the Regional Administrator will instruct the insurer to make reimbursements in those amounts as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing, if the Regional Administrator determines that the post-closure care expenditures are in accordance with the approved post-closure plan or otherwise justified. If the Regional Administrator does not instruct the insurer to make such reimbursements, he will provide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of reasons.</P>
        <P>(6) The owner or operator must maintain the policy in full force and effect until the Regional Administrator consents to termination of the policy by the owner or operator as specified in paragraph (e)(11) of this section. Failure to pay the premium, without substitution of alternate financial assurance as specified in this section, will constitute a significant violation of these regulations, warranting such remedy as the Regional Administrator deems necessary. Such violation will be deemed to begin upon receipt by the Regional Administrator of a notice of future cancellation, termination, or failure to renew due to nonpayment of the premium, rather than upon the date of expiration.</P>
        <P>(7) Each policy must contain a provision allowing assignment of the policy to a successor owner or operator. Such assignment may be conditional upon consent of the insurer, provided such consent is not unreasonably refused.</P>
        <P>(8) The policy must provide that the insurer may not cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy except for failure to pay the premium. The automatic renewal of the policy must, at a minimum, provide the insured with the option of renewal at the face amount of the expiring policy. If there is a failure to pay the premium, the insurer may elect to cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy by sending notice by certified mail to the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning with the date of receipt of the notice by both the Regional Administrator and the owner or operator, as evidenced by the return receipts. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew may not occur and the policy will remain in full force and effect in the event that on or before the date of expiration:</P>
        <P>(i) The Regional Administrator deems the facility abandoned; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The permit is terminated or revoked or a new permit is denied; or</P>
        <P>(iii) Closure is ordered by the Regional Administrator or a U.S. district court or other court of competent jurisdiction; or</P>
        <P>(iv) The owner or operator is named as debtor in a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code; or</P>
        <P>(v) The premium due is paid.</P>

        <P>(9) Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the face amount of the policy during the operating life of the facility, the owner or operator, within <PRTPAGE P="484"/>60 days after the increase, must either cause the face amount to be increased to an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the increase. Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate decreases during the operating life of the facility, the face amount may be reduced to the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(10) Commencing on the date that liability to make payments pursuant to the policy accrues, the insurer will thereafter annually increase the face amount of the policy. Such increase must be equivalent to the face amount of the policy, less any payments made, multiplied by an amount equivalent to 85 percent of the most recent investment rate or of the equivalent coupon-issue yield announced by the U.S. Treasury for 26-week Treasury securities.</P>
        <P>(11) The Regional Administrator will give written consent to the owner or operator that he may terminate the insurance policy when:</P>
        <P>(i) An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.145(i).</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Financial test and corporate guarantee for post-closure care.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by demonstrating that he passes a financial test as specified in this paragraph. To pass this test the owner or operator must meet the criteria of either paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section:</P>
        <P>(i) The owner or operator must have:</P>
        <P>(A) Two of the following three ratios: a ratio of total liabilities to net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization to total liabilities greater than 0.1; and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities greater than 1.5; and</P>
        <P>(B) Net working capital and tangible net worth each at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates; and</P>
        <P>(C) Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and</P>
        <P>(D) Assets in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of his total assets or at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates.</P>
        <P>(ii) The owner or operator must have:</P>
        <P>(A) A current rating for his most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's or Aaa, Aa, A or Baa as issued by Moody's; and</P>
        <P>(B) Tangible net worth at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates; and</P>
        <P>(C) Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and</P>
        <P>(D) Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of his total assets or at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates.</P>
        <P>(2) The phrase “current closure and post-closure cost estimates” as used in paragraph (f)(1) of this section refers to the cost estimates required to be shown in paragraphs 1-4 of the letter from the owner's or operator's chief financial officer (§ 264.151(f)). The phrase “current plugging and abandonment cost estimates” as used in paragraph (f)(1) of this section refers to the cost estimates required to be shown in paragraphs 1-4 of the letter from the owner's or operator's chief financial officer (§ 144.70(f) of this title).</P>
        <P>(3) To demonstrate that he meets this test, the owner or operator must submit the following items to the Regional Administrator:</P>
        <P>(i) A letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as specified in § 264.151(f); and</P>

        <P>(ii) A copy of the independent certified public accountant's report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year; and<PRTPAGE P="485"/>
        </P>
        <P>(iii) A special report from the owner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator stating that:</P>
        <P>(A) He has compared the data which the letter from the chief financial officer specifies as having been derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements; and</P>
        <P>(B) In connection with that procedure, no matters came to his attention which caused him to believe that the specified data should be adjusted.</P>
        <P>(4) An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for disposal.</P>
        <P>(5) After the initial submission of items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the owner or operator must send updated information to the Regional Administrator within 90 days after the close of each succeeding fiscal year. This information must consist of all three items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(6) If the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, he must send notice to the Regional Administrator of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section. The notice must be sent by certified mail within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements. The owner or operator must provide the alternate financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(7) The Regional Administrator may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, require reports of financial condition at any time from the owner or operator in addition to those specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If the Regional Administrator finds, on the basis of such reports or other information, that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section within 30 days after notification of such a finding.</P>
        <P>(8) The Regional Administrator may disallow use of this test on the basis of qualifications in the opinion expressed by the independent certified public accountant in his report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements (see paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section). An adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion will be cause for disallowance. The Regional Administrator will evaluate other qualifications on an individual basis. The owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section within 30 days after notification of the disallowance.</P>
        <P>(9) During the period of post-closure care, the Regional Administrator may approve a decrease in the current post-closure cost estimate for which this test demonstrates financial assurance if the owner or operator demonstrates to the Regional Administrator that the amount of the cost estimate exceeds the remaining cost of post-closure care.</P>
        <P>(10) The owner or operator is no longer required to submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section when:</P>
        <P>(i) An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with § 264.145(i).</P>

        <P>(11) An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a written guarantee. The guarantor must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraphs (f)(1) through (9) of this section and must comply with the terms of the guarantee. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(h). A certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the <PRTPAGE P="486"/>items sent to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. One of these items must be the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, the letter must describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator, this letter must describe this “substantial business relationship” and the value received in consideration of the guarantee. The terms of the guarantee must provide that:</P>
        <P>(i) If the owner or operator fails to perform post-closure care of a facility covered by the corporate guarantee in accordance with the post-closure plan and other permit requirements whenever required to do so, the guarantor will do so or establish a trust fund as specified in § 264.145(a) in the name of the owner or operator.</P>
        <P>(ii) The corporate guarantee will remain in force unless the guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the Regional Administrator. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, as evidenced by the return receipts.</P>
        <P>(iii) If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section and obtain the written approval of such alternate assurance from the Regional Administrator within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice of cancellation of the corporate guarantee from the guarantor, the guarantor will provide such alternate financial assurance in the name of the owner or operator.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Use of multiple financial mechanisms.</E> An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing more than one financial mechanism per facility. These mechanisms are limited to trust funds, surety bonds guaranteeing payment into a trust fund, letters of credit, and insurance. The mechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e), respectively, of this section, except that it is the combination of mechanisms, rather than the single mechanism, which must provide financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund in combination with a surety bond or a letter of credit, he may use the trust fund as the standby trust fund for the other mechanisms. A single standby trust fund may be established for two or more mechanisms. The Regional Administrator may use any or all of the mechanisms to provide for post-closure care of the facility.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Use of a financial mechanism for multiple facilities.</E> An owner or operator may use a financial assurance mechanism specified in this section to meet the requirements of this section for more than one facility. Evidence of financial assurance submitted to the Regional Administrator must include a list showing, for each facility, the EPA Identification Number, name, address, and the amount of funds for post-closure care assured by the mechanism. If the facilities covered by the mechanism are in more than one Region, identical evidence of financial assurance must be submitted to and maintained with the Regional Administrators of all such Regions. The amount of funds available through the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that would be available if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained for each facility. In directing funds available through the mechanism for post-closure care of any of the facilities covered by the mechanism, the Regional Administrator may direct only the amount of funds designated for that facility, unless the owner or operator agrees to the use of additional funds available under the mechanism.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Release of the owner or operator from the requirements of this section.</E> Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and a qualified Professional Engineer that the post-closure care period has been completed for a hazardous waste disposal unit in accordance with the approved plan, the Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator that he is no longer required to <PRTPAGE P="487"/>maintain financial assurance for post-closure of that unit, unless the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that post-closure care has not been in accordance with the approved post-closure plan. The Regional Administrator shall provide the owner or operator a detailed written statement of any such reason to believe that post-closure care has not been in accordance with the approved post-closure plan.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Liability requirements.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Coverage for sudden accidental occurrences.</E> An owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility, or a group of such facilities, must demonstrate financial responsibility for bodily injury and property damage to third parties caused by sudden accidental occurrences arising from operations of the facility or group of facilities. The owner or operator must have and maintain liability coverage for sudden accidental occurrences in the amount of at least $1 million per occurrence with an annual aggregate of at least $2 million, exclusive of legal defense costs. This liability coverage may be demonstrated as specified in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) of this section:</P>
        <P>(1) An owner or operator may demonstrate the required liability coverage by having liability insurance as specified in this paragraph.</P>

The wording of the endorsement must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(i). The wording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(j). The owner or operator must submit a signed duplicate original of the endorsement or the certificate of insurance to the Regional Administrator, or Regional Administrators if the facilities are located in more than one Region. If requested by a Regional Administrator, the owner or operator must provide a signed duplicate original of the insurance policy. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the signed duplicate original of the Hazardous Waste Facility Liability Endorsement or the Certificate of Liability Insurance to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal. The insurance must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste.</P>
        <P>(ii) Each insurance policy must be issued by an insurer which, at a minimum, is licensed to transact the business of insurance, or eligible to provide insurance as an excess or surplus lines insurer, in one or more States.</P>

        <P>(5) An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a trust fund for liability coverage as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="488"/>
        </P>
        <P>(6) An owner or operator may demonstrate the required liability coverage through the use of combinations of insurance, financial test, guarantee, letter of credit, surety bond, and trust fund, except that the owner or operator may not combine a financial test covering part of the liability coverage requirement with a guarantee unless the financial statement of the owner or operator is not consolidated with the financial statement of the guarantor. The amounts of coverage demonstrated must total at least the minimum amounts required by this section. If the owner or operator demonstrates the required coverage through the use of a combination of financial assurances under this paragraph, the owner or operator shall specify at least one such assurance as “primary” coverage and shall specify other assurance as “excess” coverage.</P>
        <P>(7) An owner or operator shall notify the Regional Administrator in writing within 30 days whenever:</P>
        <P>(i) A claim results in a reduction in the amount of financial assurance for liability coverage provided by a financial instrument authorized in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) A Certification of Valid Claim for bodily injury or property damages caused by a sudden or non-sudden accidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility is entered between the owner or operator and third-party claimant for liability coverage under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section; or</P>
        <P>(iii) A final court order establishing a judgment for bodily injury or property damage caused by a sudden or non-sudden accidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility is issued against the owner or operator or an instrument that is providing financial assurance for liability coverage under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Coverage for nonsudden accidental occurrences.</E> An owner or operator of a surface impoundment, landfill, land treatment facility, or disposal miscellaneous unit that is used to manage hazardous waste, or a group of such facilities, must demonstrate financial responsibility for bodily injury and property damage to third parties caused by nonsudden accidental occurrences arising from operations of the facility or group of facilities. The owner or operator must have and maintain liability coverage for nonsudden accidental occurrences in the amount of at least $3 million per occurrence with an annual aggregate of at least $6 million, exclusive of legal defense costs. An owner or operator who must meet the requirements of this section may combine the required per-occurrence coverage levels for sudden and nonsudden accidental occurrences into a single per-occurrence level, and combine the required annual aggregate coverage levels for sudden and nonsudden accidental occurrences into a single annual aggregate level. Owners or operators who combine coverage levels for sudden and nonsudden accidental occurrences must maintain liability coverage in the amount of at least $4 million per occurrence and $8 million annual aggregate. This liability coverage may be demonstrated as specified in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6), of this section:</P>
        <P>(1) An owner or operator may demonstrate the required liability coverage by having liability insurance as specified in this paragraph.</P>

        <P>(i) Each insurance policy must be amended by attachment of the Hazardous Waste Facility Liability Endorsement or evidenced by a Certificate of Liability Insurance. The wording of the endorsement must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(i). The wording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(j). The owner or operator must submit a signed duplicate original of the endorsement or the certificate of insurance to the Regional Administrator, or Regional Administrators if the facilities are located in more than one Region. If requested by a Regional Administrator, the owner or operator must provide a signed duplicate original of the insurance policy. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the signed duplicate original of the <PRTPAGE P="489"/>Hazardous Waste Facility Liability Endorsement or the Certificate of Liability Insurance to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal. The insurance must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste.</P>
        <P>(ii) Each insurance policy must be issued by an insurer which, at a minimum, is licensed to transact the business of insurance, or eligible to provide insurance as an excess or surplus lines insurer, in one or more States.</P>
        <P>(2) An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by passing a financial test or using the guarantee for liability coverage as specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a letter of credit for liability coverage as specified in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
        <P>(4) An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a surety bond for liability coverage as specified in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
        <P>(5) An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a trust fund for liability coverage as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
        <P>(6) An owner or operator may demonstrate the required liability coverage through the use of combinations of insurance, financial test, guarantee, letter of credit, surety bond, and trust fund, except that the owner or operator may not combine a financial test covering part of the liability coverage requirement with a guarantee unless the financial statement of the owner or operator is not consolidated with the financial statement of the guarantor. The amounts of coverage demonstrated must total at least the minimum amount required by this section. If the owner or operator demonstrates the required coverage through the use of a combination of financial assurances under this paragraph, the owner or operator shall specify at least one such assurance as “primary” coverage and shall specify other assurance as “excess” coverage.</P>
        <P>(7) An owner or operator shall notify the Regional Administrator in writing within 30 days whenever:</P>
        <P>(i) A Claim results in a reduction in the amount of financial assurance for liability coverage provided by a financial instrument authorized in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) A Certification of Valid Claim for bodily injury or property damages caused by a sudden or non-sudden accidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility is entered between the owner or operator and third-party claimant for liability coverage under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section; or</P>
        <P>(iii) A final court order establishing a judgment for bodily injury or property damage caused by a sudden or non-sudden accidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility is issued against the owner or operator or an instrument that is providing financial assurance for liability coverage under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Request for variance.</E> If an owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Regional Administrator that the levels of financial responsibility required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not consistent with the degree and duration of risk associated with treatment, storage, or disposal at the facility or group of facilities, the owner or operator may obtain a variance from the Regional Administrator. The request for a variance must be submitted to the Regional Administrator as part of the application under § 270.14 of this chapter for a facility that does not have a permit, or pursuant to the procedures for permit modification under § 124.5 of this chapter for a facility that has a permit. If granted, the variance will take the form of an adjusted level of required liability coverage, such level to be based on the Regional Administrator's assessment of the degree and duration of risk associated with the ownership or operation of the facility or group of facilities. The Regional Administrator may require an owner or operator who requests a variance to provide such technical and <PRTPAGE P="490"/>engineering information as is deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine a level of financial responsibility other than that required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. Any request for a variance for a permitted facility will be treated as a request for a permit modification under §§ 270.41(a)(5) and 124.5 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Adjustments by the Regional Administrator.</E> If the Regional Administrator determines that the levels of financial responsibility required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not consistent with the degree and duration of risk associated with treatment, storage, or disposal at the facility or group of facilities, the Regional Administrator may adjust the level of financial responsibility required under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment. This adjusted level will be based on the Regional Administrator's assessment of the degree and duration of risk associated with the ownership or operation of the facility or group of facilities. In addition, if the Regional Administrator determines that there is a significant risk to human health and the environment from nonsudden accidental occurrences resulting from the operations of a facility that is not a surface impoundment, landfill, or land treatment facility, he may require that an owner or operator of the facility comply with paragraph (b) of this section. An owner or operator must furnish to the Regional Administrator, within a reasonable time, any information which the Regional Administrator requests to determine whether cause exists for such adjustments of level or type of coverage. Any adjustment of the level or type of coverage for a facility that has a permit will be treated as a permit modification under §§ 270.41(a)(5) and 124.5 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Period of coverage.</E> Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and a qualified Professional Engineer that final closure has been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan, the Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing that he is no longer required by this section to maintain liability coverage for that facility, unless the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that closure has not been in accordance with the approved closure plan.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Financial test for liability coverage.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by demonstrating that he passes a financial test as specified in this paragraph. To pass this test the owner or operator must meet the criteria of paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (ii):</P>
        <P>(i) The owner or operator must have:</P>
        <P>(A) Net working capital and tangible net worth each at least six times the amount of liability coverage to be demonstrated by this test; and</P>
        <P>(B) Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and</P>
        <P>(C) Assets in the United States amounting to either: (<E T="03">1</E>) At least 90 percent of his total assets; or (<E T="03">2</E>) at least six times the amount of liability coverage to be demonstrated by this test.</P>
        <P>(ii) The owner or operator must have:</P>
        <P>(A) A current rating for his most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's, or Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa as issued by Moody's; and</P>
        <P>(B) Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and</P>
        <P>(C) Tangible net worth at least six times the amount of liability coverage to be demonstrated by this test; and</P>
        <P>(D) Assets in the United States amounting to either: (<E T="03">1</E>) At least 90 percent of his total assets; or (<E T="03">2</E>) at least six times the amount of liability coverage to be demonstrated by this test.</P>
        <P>(2) The phrase “amount of liability coverage” as used in paragraph (f)(1) of this section refers to the annual aggregate amounts for which coverage is required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) To demonstrate that he meets this test, the owner or operator must submit the following three items to the Regional Administrator:</P>

        <P>(i) A letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as specified in § 264.151(g). If an owner or operator is using the financial test to demonstrate both assurance for closure or post-closure care, as specified by §§ 264.143(f), 264.145(f), 265.143(e), and 265.145(e), and liability coverage, he must submit the letter specified in <PRTPAGE P="491"/>§ 264.151(g) to cover both forms of financial responsibility; a separate letter as specified in § 264.151(f) is not required.</P>
        <P>(ii) A copy of the independent certified public accountant's report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(iii) A special report from the owner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator stating that:</P>
        <P>(A) He has compared the data which the letter from the chief financial officer specifies as having been derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements; and</P>
        <P>(B) In connection with that procedure, no matters came to his attention which caused him to believe that the specified data should be adjusted.</P>
        <P>(4) An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage, or disposal.</P>
        <P>(5) After the initial submission of items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the owner or operator must send updated information to the Regional Administrator within 90 days after the close of each succeeding fiscal year. This information must consist of all three items specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(6) If the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, he must obtain insurance, a letter of credit, a surety bond, a trust fund, or a guarantee for the entire amount of required liability coverage as specified in this section. Evidence of liability coverage must be submitted to the Regional Administrator within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or operator no longer meets the test requirements.</P>
        <P>(7) The Regional Administrator may disallow use of this test on the basis of qualifications in the opinion expressed by the independent certified public accountant in his report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements (see paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section). An adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion will be cause for disallowance. The Regional Administrator will evaluate other qualifications on an individual basis. The owner or operator must provide evidence of insurance for the entire amount of required liability coverage as specified in this section within 30 days after notification of disallowance.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Guarantee for liability coverage.</E> (1) Subject to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, an owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a written guarantee, hereinafter referred to as “guarantee.” The guarantor must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(6) of this section. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(h)(2) of this part. A certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the items sent to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. One of these items must be the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, this letter must describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator, this letter must describe this “substantial business relationship” and the value received in consideration of the guarantee.</P>

        <P>(i) If the owner or operator fails to satisfy a judgment based on a determination of liability for bodily injury or property damage to third parties caused by sudden or nonsudden accidental occurrences (or both as the case may be), arising from the operation of facilities covered by this corporate guarantee, or fails to pay an amount agreed to in settlement of claims arising from or alleged to arise from such injury or damage, the guarantor will do so up to the limits of coverage.<PRTPAGE P="492"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
        <P>(2)(i) In the case of corporations incorporated in the United States, a guarantee may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section only if the Attorneys General or Insurance Commissioners of (A) the State in which the guarantor is incorporated, and (B) each State in which a facility covered by the guarantee is located have submitted a written statement to EPA that a guarantee executed as described in this section and § 264.151(h)(2) is a legally valid and enforceable obligation in that State.</P>
        <P>(ii) In the case of corporations incorporated outside the United States, a guarantee may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section only if (A) the non-U.S. corporation has identified a registered agent for service of process in each State in which a facility covered by the guarantee is located and in the State in which it has its principal place of business, and (B) the Attorney General or Insurance Commissioner of each State in which a facility covered by the guarantee is located and the State in which the guarantor corporation has its principal place of business, has submitted a written statement to EPA that a guarantee executed as described in this section and § 264.151(h)(2) is a legally valid and enforceable obligation in that State.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Letter of credit for liability coverage.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining an irrevocable standby letter of credit that conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting a copy of the letter of credit to the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(2) The financial institution issuing the letter of credit must be an entity that has the authority to issue letters of credit and whose letter of credit operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</P>
        <P>(3) The wording of the letter of credit must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(k) of this part.</P>
        <P>(4) An owner or operator who uses a letter of credit to satisfy the requirements of this section may also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of such a letter of credit, all amounts paid pursuant to a draft by the trustee of the standby trust will be deposited by the issuing institution into the standby trust in accordance with instructions from the trustee. The trustee of the standby trust fund must be an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</P>
        <P>(5) The wording of the standby trust fund must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(n).</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Surety bond for liability coverage.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining a surety bond that conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting a copy of the bond to the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(2) The surety company issuing the bond must be among those listed as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in the most recent Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</P>
        <P>(3) The wording of the surety bond must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(l) of this part.</P>
        <P>(4) A surety bond may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section only if the Attorneys General or Insurance Commissioners of (i) the State in which the surety is incorporated, and (ii) each State in which a facility covered by the surety bond is located have submitted a written statement to EPA that a surety bond executed as described in this section and § 264.151(l) of this part is a legally valid and enforceable obligation in that State.</P>
        <P>(j) <E T="03">Trust fund for liability coverage.</E> (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing a trust fund that conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator.</P>

        <P>(3) The trust fund for liability coverage must be funded for the full amount of the liability coverage to be provided by the trust fund before it may be relied upon to satisfy the requirements of this section. If at any time after the trust fund is created the <PRTPAGE P="493"/>amount of funds in the trust fund is reduced below the full amount of the liability coverage to be provided, the owner or operator, by the anniversary date of the establishment of the fund, must either add sufficient funds to the trust fund to cause its value to equal the full amount of liability coverage to be provided, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the difference. For purposes of this paragraph, “the full amount of the liability coverage to be provided” means the amount of coverage for sudden and/or nonsudden occurrences required to be provided by the owner or operator by this section, less the amount of financial assurance for liability coverage that is being provided by other financial assurance mechanisms being used to demonstrate financial assurance by the owner or operator.</P>
        <P>(4) The wording of the trust fund must be identical to the wording specified in § 264.151(m) of this part.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Use of State-required mechanisms.</SUBJECT>

        <P>(a) For a facility located in a State where EPA is administering the requirements of this subpart but where the State has hazardous waste regulations that include requirements for financial assurance of closure or post-closure care or liability coverage, an owner or operator may use State-required financial mechanisms to meet the requirements of § 264.143, § 264.145, or § 264.147, if the Regional Administrator determines that the State mechanisms are at least equivalent to the financial mechanism specified in this subpart. The Regional Administrator will evaluate the equivalency of the mechanisms principally in terms of (1) certainty of the availability of funds for the required closure or post-closure care activities or liability coverage and (2) the amount of funds that will be made available. The Regional Administrator may also consider other factors as he deems appropriate. The owner or operator must submit to the Regional Administrator evidence of the establishment of the mechanism together with a letter requesting that the State-required mechanism be considered acceptable for meeting the requirements of this subpart. The submission must include the following information: The facility's EPA Identification Number, name, and address, and the amount of funds for closure or post-closure care or liability coverage assured by the <PRTPAGE P="494"/>mechanism. The Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator of his determination regarding the mechanism's acceptability in lieu of financial mechanisms specified in this subpart. The Regional Administrator may require the owner or operator to submit additional information as is deemed necessary to make this determination. Pending this determination, the owner or operator will be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of § 264.143, § 264.145, or § 264.147, as applicable.</P>
        <P>(b) If a State-required mechanism is found acceptable as specified in paragraph (a) of this section except for the amount of funds available, the owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this subpart by increasing the funds available through the State-required mechanism or using additional financial mechanisms as specified in this subpart. The amount of funds available through the State and Federal mechanisms must at least equal the amount required by this subpart.</P>

        <SUBJECT>State assumption of responsibility.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) If a State either assumes legal responsibility for an owner's or operator's compliance with the closure, post-closure care, or liability requirements of this part or assures that funds will be available from State sources to cover those requirements, the owner or operator will be in compliance with the requirements of § 264.143, § 264.145, or § 264.147 if the Regional Administrator determines that the State's assumption of responsibility is at least equivalent to the financial mechanisms specified in this subpart. The Regional Administrator will evaluate the equivalency of State guarantees principally in terms of (1) certainty of the availability of funds for the required closure or post-closure care activities or liability coverage and (2) the amount of funds that will be made available. The Regional Administrator may also consider other factors as he deems appropriate. The owner or operator must submit to the Regional Administrator a letter from the State describing the nature of the State's assumption of responsibility together with a letter from the owner or operator requesting that the State's assumption of responsibility be considered acceptable for meeting the requirements of this subpart. The letter from the State must include, or have attached to it, the following information: the facility's EPA Identification Number, name, and address, and the amount of funds for closure or post-closure care or liability coverage that are guaranteed by the State. The Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator of his determination regarding the acceptability of the State's guarantee in lieu of financial mechanisms specified in this subpart. The Regional Administrator may require the owner or operator to submit additional information as is deemed necessary to make this determination. Pending this determination, the owner or operator will be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of § 264.143, § 264.145, or § 264.147, as applicable.</P>

        <P>(b) If a State's assumption of responsibility is found acceptable as specified in paragraph (a) of this section except for the amount of funds available, the owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this subpart by use of both the State's assurance <E T="03">and</E> additional financial mechanisms as specified in this subpart. The amount of funds available through the State and Federal mechanisms must at least equal the amount required by this subpart.</P>

          <P>Know All Persons By These Presents, That we, the Principal and Surety(ies) hereto are firmly bound to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (hereinafter called EPA), in the above penal sum for the payment of which we bind ourselves, our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns jointly and severally; provided that, where the Surety(ies) are corporations acting as co-sureties, we, the Sureties, bind ourselves in such sum “jointly and severally” only for the purpose of allowing a joint action or actions against any or all of us, and for all other purposes each Surety binds itself, jointly and severally with the Principal, for the payment of such sum only as is set forth opposite the name of such Surety, but if no limit of liability is indicated, the limit of liability shall be the full amount of the penal sum.</P>
          <P>Whereas said Principal is required, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as amended (RCRA), to have a permit or interim status in order to own or operate each hazardous waste management facility identified above, and</P>
          <P>Whereas said Principal is required to provide financial assurance for closure, or closure and post-closure care, as a condition of the permit or interim status, and</P>
          <P>Whereas said Principal shall establish a standby trust fund as is required when a surety bond is used to provide such financial assurance;</P>
          <P>Now, Therefore, the conditions of the obligation are such that if the Principal shall faithfully, before the beginning of final closure of each facility identified above, fund the standby trust fund in the amount(s) identified above for the facility,</P>
          <P>Or, if the Principal shall fund the standby trust fund in such amount(s) within 15 days after a final order to begin closure is issued by an EPA Regional Administrator or a U.S. district court or other court of competent jurisdiction,</P>
          <P>Or, if the Principal shall provide alternate financial assurance, as specified in subpart H of 40 CFR part 264 or 265, as applicable, and obtain the EPA Regional Administrator's written approval of such assurance, within 90 days after the date notice of cancellation is received by both the Principal and the EPA Regional Administrator(s) from the Surety(ies), then this obligation shall be null and void; otherwise it is to remain in full force and effect.</P>
          <P>The Surety(ies) shall become liable on this bond obligation only when the Principal has failed to fulfill the conditions described above. Upon notification by an EPA Regional Administrator that the Principal has failed to perform as guaranteed by this bond, the Surety(ies) shall place funds in the amount guaranteed for the facility(ies) into the standby trust fund as directed by the EPA Regional Administrator.</P>
          <P>The liability of the Surety(ies) shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or payments shall amount in the aggregate to the penal sum of the bond, but in no event shall the obligation of the Surety(ies) hereunder exceed the amount of said penal sum.</P>
          <P>The Surety(ies) may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the Principal and to the EPA Regional Administrator(s) for the Region(s) in which the facility(ies) is (are) located, provided, however, that cancellation shall not occur during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the Principal and the EPA Regional Administrator(s), as evidenced by the return receipts.</P>
          <P>The Principal may terminate this bond by sending written notice to the Surety(ies), provided, however, that no such notice shall become effective until the Surety(ies) receive(s) written authorization for termination of the bond by the EPA Regional Administrator(s) of the EPA Region(s) in which the bonded facility(ies) is (are) located.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Closure and post-closure care.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) At closure of a tank system, the owner or operator must remove or decontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system components (liners, etc.), contaminated soils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste, and manage them as hazardous waste, unless § 261.3(d) of this chapter applies. The closure plan, closure activities, cost estimates for closure, and financial responsibility for tank systems must meet all of the requirements specified in subparts G and H of this part.</P>
        <P>(b) If the owner or operator demonstrates that not all contaminated soils can be practicably removed or decontaminated as required in paragraph (a) of this section, then the owner or operator must close the tank system and perform post-closure care in accordance with the closure and post-closure care requirements that apply to landfills (§ 264.310). In addition, for the purposes of closure, post-closure, and financial responsibility, such a tank system is then considered to be a landfill, and the owner or operator must meet all of the requirements for landfills specified in subparts G and H of this part.</P>
        <P>(c) If an owner or operator has a tank system that does not have secondary containment that meets the requirements of § 264.193 (b) through (f) and has not been granted a variance from the secondary containment requirements in accordance with § 264.193(g), then:</P>
        <P>(1) The closure plan for the tank system must include both a plan for complying with paragraph (a) of this section and a contingent plan for complying with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) A contingent post-closure plan for complying with paragraph (b) of this section must be prepared and submitted as part of the permit application.</P>
        <P>(3) The cost estimates calculated for closure and post-closure care must reflect the costs of complying with the contingent closure plan and the contingent post-closure plan, if those costs are greater than the costs of complying with the closure plan prepared for the expected closure under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
        <P>(4) Financial assurance must be based on the cost estimates in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(5) For the purposes of the contingent closure and post-closure plans, such a tank system is considered to be a landfill, and the contingent plans must meet all of the closure, post-closure, and financial responsibility requirements for landfills under subparts G and H of this part.</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 264.221</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Design and operating requirements.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Any surface impoundment that is not covered by paragraph (c) of this section or § 265.221 of this chapter must have a liner for all portions of the impoundment (except for existing portions of such impoundments). The liner must be designed, constructed, and installed to prevent any migration of wastes out of the impoundment to the adjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water at any time during the active life (including the closure period) of the impoundment. The liner may be constructed of materials that may allow wastes to migrate into the liner (but not into the adjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water) during the active life of the facility, provided that the impoundment is closed in accordance with § 264.228(a)(1). For impoundments that will be closed in accordance with § 264.228(a)(2), the liner must be constructed of materials that can prevent wastes from migrating into the liner during the active life of the facility. The liner must be:</P>
        <P>(1) Constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head and external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the waste or leachate to which they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and the stress of daily operation;</P>
        <P>(2) Placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support to the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner to prevent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression, or uplift; and</P>
        <P>(3) Installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with the waste or leachate.</P>
        <P>(b) The owner or operator will be exempted from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the Regional Administrator finds, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator, that alternate design and operating practices, together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituents (see § 264.93) into the ground water or surface water at any future time. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Regional Administrator will consider:</P>
        <P>(1) The nature and quantity of the wastes;</P>
        <P>(2) The proposed alternate design and operation;</P>
        <P>(3) The hydrogeologic setting of the facility, including the attenuative capacity and thickness of the liners and soils present between the impoundment and ground water or surface water; and</P>
        <P>(4) All other factors which would influence the quality and mobility of the leachate produced and the potential for it to migrate to ground water or surface water.</P>

        <P>(c) The owner or operator of each new surface impoundment unit on which construction commences after January 29, 1992, each lateral expansion of a surface impoundment unit on which construction commences after July 29, 1992 and each replacement of an existing surface impoundment unit that is to commence reuse after July 29, 1992 must install two or more liners and a leachate collection and removal system between such liners. “Construction commences” is as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter under “existing facility”.<PRTPAGE P="533"/>
        </P>
        <P>(1)(i) The <E T="03">liner system</E> must include:</P>
        <P>(A) A top liner designed and constructed of materials (e.g., a geomembrane) to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into such liner during the active life and post-closure care period; and</P>

        <P>(B) A composite bottom liner, consisting of at least two components. The upper component must be designed and constructed of materials (e.g., a geomembrane) to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into this component during the active life and post-closure care period. The lower component must be designed and constructed of materials to minimize the migration of hazardous constituents if a breach in the upper component were to occur. The lower component must be constructed of at least 3 feet (91 cm) of compacted soil material with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1×10<E T="51">−7</E> cm/sec.</P>
        <P>(ii) The liners must comply with paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) The <E T="03">leachate collection and removal system</E> between the liners, and immediately above the bottom composite liner in the case of multiple leachate collection and removal systems, is also a <E T="03">leak detection system.</E> This leak detection system must be capable of detecting, collecting, and removing leaks of hazardous constituents at the earliest practicable time through all areas of the top liner likely to be exposed to waste or leachate during the active life and post-closure care period. The requirements for a leak detection system in this paragraph are satisfied by installation of a system that is, at a minimum:</P>
        <P>(i) Constructed with a bottom slope of one percent or more;</P>

        <P>(ii) Constructed of granular drainage materials with a hydraulic conductivity of 1×10<E T="51">−1</E> cm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches (30.5 cm) or more; or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials with a transmissivity of 3×10<E T="51">−4</E> m<SU>2</SU>sec or more;</P>
        <P>(iii) Constructed of materials that are chemically resistant to the waste managed in the surface impoundment and the leachate expected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes and any waste cover materials or equipment used at the surface impoundment;</P>
        <P>(iv) Designed and operated to minimize clogging during the active life and post-closure care period; and</P>
        <P>(v) Constructed with sumps and liquid removal methods (e.g., pumps) of sufficient size to collect and remove liquids from the sump and prevent liquids from backing up into the drainage layer. Each unit must have its own sump(s). The design of each sump and removal system must provide a method for measuring and recording the volume of liquids present in the sump and of liquids removed.</P>
        <P>(3) The owner or operator shall collect and remove pumpable liquids in the sumps to minimize the head on the bottom liner.</P>
        <P>(4) The owner or operator of a leak detection system that is not located completely above the seasonal high water table must demonstrate that the operation of the leak detection system will not be adversely affected by the presence of ground water.</P>
        <P>(d) The Regional Administrator may approve alternative design or operating practices to those specified in paragraph (c) of this section if the owner or operator demonstrates to the Regional Administrator that such design and operating practices, together with location characteristics:</P>
        <P>(1) Will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituent into the ground water or surface water at least as effectively as the liners and leachate collection and removal system specified in paragraph (c) of this section; and</P>
        <P>(2) Will allow detection of leaks of hazardous constituents through the top liner at least as effectively.</P>
        <P>(e) The double liner requirement set forth in paragraph (c) of this section may be waived by the Regional Administrator for any monofill, if:</P>

        <P>(1) The monofill contains only hazardous wastes from foundry furnace emission controls or metal casting molding sand, and such wastes do not contain constituents which would render the wastes hazardous for reasons other than the toxicity characteristic in § 261.24 of this chapter; and<PRTPAGE P="534"/>
        </P>
        <P>(2)(i)(A) The monofill has at least one liner for which there is no evidence that such liner is leaking. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “liner” means a liner designed, constructed, installed, and operated to prevent hazardous waste from passing into the liner at any time during the active life of the facility, or a liner designed, constructed, installed, and operated to prevent hazardous waste from migrating beyond the liner to adjacent subsurface soil, ground water, or surface water at any time during the active life of the facility. In the case of any surface impoundment which has been exempted from the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section on the basis of a liner designed, constructed, installed, and operated to prevent hazardous waste from passing beyond the liner, at the closure of such impoundment, the owner or operator must remove or decontaminate all waste residues, all contaminated liner material, and contaminated soil to the extent practicable. If all contaminated soil is not removed or decontaminated, the owner or operator of such impoundment will comply with appropriate post-closure requirements, including but not limited to ground-water monitoring and corrective action;</P>
        <P>(B) The monofill is located more than one-quarter mile from an “underground source of drinking water” (as that term is defined in 40 CFR 270.2); and</P>
        <P>(C) The monofill is in compliance with generally applicable ground-water monitoring requirements for facilities with permits under RCRA section 3005(c); or</P>
        <P>(ii) The owner or operator demonstrates that the monofill is located, designed and operated so as to assure that there will be no migration of any hazardous constituent into ground water or surface water at any future time.</P>
        <P>(f) The owner or operator of any replacement surface impoundment unit is exempt from paragraph (c) of this section if:</P>
        <P>(1) The existing unit was constructed in compliance with the design standards of sections 3004 (o)(1)(A)(i) and (o)(5) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and</P>
        <P>(2) There is no reason to believe that the liner is not functioning as designed.</P>
        <P>(g) A surface impoundment must be designed, constructed, maintained, and operated to prevent overtopping resulting from normal or abnormal operations; overfilling; wind and wave action; rainfall; run-on; malfunctions of level controllers, alarms, and other equipment; and human error.</P>
        <P>(h) A surface impoundment must have dikes that are designed, constructed, and maintained with sufficient structural integrity to prevent massive failure of the dikes. In ensuring structural integrity, it must not be presumed that the liner system will function without leakage during the active life of the unit.</P>
        <P>(i) The Regional Administrator will specify in the permit all design and operating practices that are necessary to ensure that the requirements of this section are satisfied.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Action leakage rate.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) The Regional Administrator shall approve an action leakage rate for surface impoundment units subject to § 264.221 (c) or (d). The action leakage rate is the maximum design flow rate that the leak detection system (LDS) can remove without the fluid head on the bottom liner exceeding 1 foot. The action leakage rate must include an adequate safety margin to allow for uncertainties in the design (e.g., slope, hydraulic conductivity, thickness of drainage material), construction, operation, and location of the LDS, waste and leachate characteristics, likelihood and amounts of other sources of liquids in the LDS, and proposed response actions (e.g., the action leakage rate must consider decreases in the flow capacity of the system over time resulting from siltation and clogging, rib layover and creep of synthetic components of the system, overburden pressures, etc.).</P>

        <P>(b) To determine if the action leakage rate has been exceeded, the owner or operator must convert the weekly or monthly flow rate from the monitoring <PRTPAGE P="535"/>data obtained under § 264.226(d) to an average daily flow rate (gallons per acre per day) for each sump. Unless the Regional Administrator approves a different calculation, the average daily flow rate for each sump must be calculated weekly during the active life and closure period, and if the unit is closed in accordance with § 264.228(b), monthly during the post-closure care period when monthly monitoring is required under § 264.226(d).</P>

        <SUBJECT>Response actions.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) The owner or operator of surface impoundment units subject to § 264.221 (c) or (d) must have an approved response action plan before receipt of waste. The response action plan must set forth the actions to be taken if the action leakage rate has been exceeded. At a minimum, the response action plan must describe the actions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
        <P>(b) If the flow rate into the leak detection system exceeds the action leakage rate for any sump, the owner or operator must:</P>
        <P>(1) Notify the Regional Administrator in writing of the exceedance within 7 days of the determination;</P>
        <P>(2) Submit a preliminary written assessment to the Regional Administrator within 14 days of the determination, as to the amount of liquids, likely sources of liquids, possible location, size, and cause of any leaks, and short-term actions taken and planned;</P>
        <P>(3) Determine to the extent practicable the location, size, and cause of any leak;</P>
        <P>(4) Determine whether waste receipt should cease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be removed from the unit for inspection, repairs, or controls, and whether or not the unit should be closed;</P>
        <P>(5) Determine any other short-term and longer-term actions to be taken to mitigate or stop any leaks; and</P>
        <P>(6) Within 30 days after the notification that the action leakage rate has been exceeded, submit to the Regional Administrator the results of the analyses specified in paragraphs (b) (3), (4), and (5) of this section, the results of actions taken, and actions planned. Monthly thereafter, as long as the flow rate in the leak detection system exceeds the action leakage rate, the owner or operator must submit to the Regional Administrator a report summarizing the results of any remedial actions taken and actions planned.</P>
        <P>(c) To make the leak and/or remediation determinations in paragraphs (b) (3), (4), and (5) of this section, the owner or operator must:</P>
        <P>(1)(i) Assess the source of liquids and amounts of liquids by source,</P>
        <P>(ii) Conduct a fingerprint, hazardous constituent, or other analyses of the liquids in the leak detection system to identify the source of liquids and possible location of any leaks, and the hazard and mobility of the liquid; and</P>
        <P>(iii) Assess the seriousness of any leaks in terms of potential for escaping into the environment; or</P>
        <P>(2) Document why such assessments are not needed.</P>

        <P>(1) Synthetic liners and covers must be inspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence of tears, punctures, or blisters; and</P>
        <P>(2) Soil-based and admixed liners and covers must be inspected for imperfections including lenses, cracks, channels, root holes, or other structural non-uniformities that may cause an increase in the permeability of the liner or cover.</P>
        <P>(b) While a surface impoundment is in operation, it must be inspected weekly and after storms to detect evidence of any of the following:</P>
        <P>(1) Deterioration, malfunctions, or improper operation of overtopping control systems;</P>

        <P>(2) Sudden drops in the level of the impoundment's contents; and<PRTPAGE P="536"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) Severe erosion or other signs of deterioration in dikes or other containment devices.</P>
        <P>(c) Prior to the issuance of a permit, and after any extended period of time (at least six months) during which the impoundment was not in service, the owner or operator must obtain a certification from a qualified engineer that the impoundment's dike, including that portion of any dike which provides freeboard, has structural integrity. The certification must establish, in particular, that the dike:</P>
        <P>(1) Will withstand the stress of the pressure exerted by the types and amounts of wastes to be placed in the impoundment; and</P>
        <P>(2) Will not fail due to scouring or piping, without dependence on any liner system included in the surface impoundment construction.</P>
        <P>(d)(1) An owner or operator required to have a leak detection system under § 264.221 (c) or (d) must record the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump at least once each week during the active life and closure period.</P>
        <P>(2) After the final cover is installed, the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump must be recorded at least monthly. If the liquid level in the sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months, the amount of liquids in the sumps must be recorded at least quarterly. If the liquid level in the sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive quarters, the amount of liquids in the sumps must be recorded at least semi-annually. If at any time during the post-closure care period the pump operating level is exceeded at units on quarterly or semi-annual recording schedules, the owner or operator must return to monthly recording of amounts of liquids removed from each sump until the liquid level again stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months.</P>
        <P>(3) “Pump operating level” is a liquid level proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator based on pump activation level, sump dimensions, and level that avoids backup into the drainage layer and minimizes head in the sump.</P>

        <P>(a) A waste pile (except for an existing portion of a waste pile) must have:</P>
        <P>(1) A liner that is designed, constructed, and installed to prevent any migration of wastes out of the pile into the adjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water at any time during the active life (including the closure period) of the waste pile. The liner may be constructed of materials that may allow waste to migrate into the liner itself (but not into the adjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water) during the active life of the facility. The liner must be:</P>
        <P>(i) Constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head and external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the waste or leachate to which they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and the stress of daily operation;</P>
        <P>(ii) Placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support to the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner to prevent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression, or uplift; and</P>
        <P>(iii) Installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with the waste or leachate; and</P>
        <P>(2) A leachate collection and removal system immediately above the liner that is designed, constructed, maintained, and operated to collect and remove leachate from the pile. The Regional Administrator will specify design and operating conditions in the permit to ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm (one foot). The leachate collection and removal system must be:</P>
        <P>(i) Constructed of materials that are:</P>
        <P>(A) Chemically resistant to the waste managed in the pile and the leachate expected to be generated; and</P>
        <P>(B) Of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlaying wastes, waste cover materials, and by any equipment used at the pile; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Designed and operated to function without clogging through the scheduled closure of the waste pile.</P>
        <P>(b) The owner or operator will be exempted from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, if the Regional Administrator finds, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator, that alternate design and operating practices, together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituents (see § 264.93) into the ground water or surface water at any future time. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Regional Administrator will consider:</P>
        <P>(1) The nature and quantity of the wastes;</P>
        <P>(2) The proposed alternate design and operation;</P>
        <P>(3) The hydrogeologic setting of the facility, including attenuative capacity and thickness of the liners and soils present between the pile and ground water or surface water; and</P>
        <P>(4) All other factors which would influence the quality and mobility of the leachate produced and the potential for it to migrate to ground water or surface water.</P>
        <P>(c) The owner or operator of each new waste pile unit, each lateral expansion of a waste pile unit, and each replacement of an existing waste pile unit must install two or more liners and a leachate collection and removal system above and between such liners.</P>
        <P>(1)(i) The liner system must include:</P>
        <P>(A) A top liner designed and constructed of materials (e.g., a geomembrane) to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into such liner during the active life and post-closure care period; and</P>

        <P>(B) A composite bottom liner, consisting of at least two components. The upper component must be designed and constructed of materials (e.g., a geomembrane) to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into this component during the active life and post-closure care period. The lower component must be designed and constructed of materials to minimize the <PRTPAGE P="540"/>migration of hazardous constituents if a breach in the upper component were to occur. The lower component must be constructed of at least 3 feet (91 cm) of compacted soil material with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1×10<E T="51">−7</E> cm/sec.</P>
        <P>(ii) The liners must comply with paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) The <E T="03">leachate collection and removal system</E> immediately above the top liner must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to collect and remove leachate from the waste pile during the active life and post-closure care period. The Regional Administrator will specify design and operating conditions in the permit to ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm (one foot). The leachate collection and removal system must comply with paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) The <E T="03">leachate collection and removal system</E> between the liners, and immediately above the bottom composite liner in the case of multiple leachate collection and removal systems, is also a <E T="03">leak detection system.</E> This leak detection system must be capable of detecting, collecting, and removing leaks of hazardous constituents at the earliest practicable time through all areas of the top liner likely to be exposed to waste or leachate during the active life and post-closure care period.

        <P>(i) Constructed with a bottom slope of one percent or more;</P>

        <P>(ii) Constructed of granular drainage materials with a hydraulic conductivity of 1×10<E T="51">−2</E> cm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches (30.5 cm) or more; or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials with a transmissivity of 3×10<E T="51">−5</E> m<SU>2</SU>/sec or more:</P>
        <P>(iii) Constructed of materials that are chemically resistant to the waste managed in the waste pile and the leachate expected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover materials, and equipment used at the waste pile;</P>
        <P>(iv) Designed and operated to minimize clogging during the active life and post-closure care period; and</P>
        <P>(v) Constructed with sumps and liquid removal methods (e.g., pumps) of sufficient size to collect and remove liquids from the sump and prevent liquids from backing up into the drainage layer. Each unit must have its own sump(s). The design of each sump and removal system must provide a method for measuring and recording the volume of liquids present in the sump and of liquids removed.</P>
        <P>(4) The owner or operator shall collect and remove pumpable liquids in the leak detection system sumps to minimize the head on the bottom liner.</P>
        <P>(5) The owner or operator of a leak detection system that is not located completely above the seasonal high water table must demonstrate that the operation of the leak detection system will not be adversely affected by the presence of ground water.</P>
        <P>(d) The Regional Administrator may approve alternative design or operating practices to those specified in paragraph (c) of this section if the owner or operator demonstrates to the Regional Administrator that such design and operating practices, together with location characteristics:</P>
        <P>(1) Will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituent into the ground water or surface water at least as effectively as the liners and leachate collection and removal systems specified in paragraph (c) of this section; and</P>
        <P>(2) Will allow detection of leaks of hazardous constituents through the top liner at least as effectively.</P>
        <P>(e) Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply to monofills that are granted a waiver by the Regional Administrator in accordance with § 264.221(e).</P>
        <P>(f) The owner or operator of any replacement waste pile unit is exempt from paragraph (c) of this section if:</P>

        <P>(a) The Regional Administrator shall approve an action leakage rate for waste pile units subject to § 264.251(c) or (d). The action leakage rate is the maximum design flow rate that the leak detection system (LDS) can remove without the fluid head on the bottom liner exceeding 1 foot. The action leakage rate must include an adequate safety margin to allow for uncertainties in the design (e.g., slope, hydraulic conductivity, thickness of drainage material), construction, operation, and location of the LDS, waste and leachate characteristics, likelihood and amounts of other sources of liquids in the LDS, and proposed response actions (e.g., the action leakage rate must consider decreases in the flow capacity of the system over time resulting from siltation and clogging, rib layover and creep of synthetic components of the system, overburden pressures, etc.).</P>
        <P>(b) To determine if the action leakage rate has been exceeded, the owner or operator must convert the weekly flow rate from the monitoring data obtained under § 264.254(c) to an average daily flow rate (gallons per acre per day) for each sump. Unless the Regional Administrator approves a different calculation, the average daily flow rate for each sump must be calculated weekly during the active life and closure period.</P>

        <P>(1) Notify the Regional Administrator in writing of the exceedance within 7 days of the determination;</P>
        <P>(2) Submit a preliminary written assessment to the Regional Administrator within 14 days of the determination, as to the amount of liquids, likely sources of liquids, possible location, size, and cause of any leaks, and short-term actions taken and planned;</P>
        <P>(3) Determine to the extent practicable the location, size, and cause of any leak;</P>
        <P>(4) Determine whether waste receipt should cease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be removed from the unit for inspection, repairs, or controls, and whether or not the unit should be closed;</P>

        <P>(1)(i) Assess the source of liquids and amounts of liquids by source,</P>
        <P>(ii) Conduct a fingerprint, hazardous constituent, or other analyses of the liquids in the leak detection system to identify the source of liquids and possible location of any leaks, and the hazard and mobility of the liquid; and</P>
        <P>(iii) Assess the seriousness of any leaks in terms of potential for escaping into the environment; or</P>

        <SUBJECT>Unsaturated zone monitoring.</SUBJECT>
        <P>An owner or operator subject to this subpart must establish an unsaturated zone monitoring program to discharge the following responsibilities:</P>
        <P>(a) The owner or operator must monitor the soil and soil-pore liquid to determine whether hazardous constituents migrate out of the treatment zone.</P>
        <P>(1) The Regional Administrator will specify the hazardous constituents to be monitored in the facility permit. The hazardous constituents to be monitored are those specified under § 264.271(b).</P>

        <P>(2) The Regional Administrator may require monitoring for principal hazardous constituents (PHCs) in lieu of the constituents specified under § 264.271(b). PHCs are hazardous constituents contained in the wastes to be applied at the unit that are the most <PRTPAGE P="547"/>difficult to treat, considering the combined effects of degradation, transformation, and immobilization. The Regional Administrator will establish PHCs if he finds, based on waste analyses, treatment demonstrations, or other data, that effective degradation, transformation, or immobilization of the PHCs will assure treatment at at least equivalent levels for the other hazardous constituents in the wastes.</P>
        <P>(b) The owner or operator must install an unsaturated zone monitoring system that includes soil monitoring using soil cores and soil-pore liquid monitoring using devices such as lysimeters. The unsaturated zone monitoring system must consist of a sufficient number of sampling points at appropriate locations and depths to yield samples that:</P>
        <P>(1) Represent the quality of background soil-pore liquid quality and the chemical make-up of soil that has not been affected by leakage from the treatment zone; and</P>
        <P>(2) Indicate the quality of soil-pore liquid and the chemical make-up of the soil below the treatment zone.</P>
        <P>(c) The owner or operator must establish a background value for each hazardous constituent to be monitored under paragraph (a) of this section. The permit will specify the background values for each constituent or specify the procedures to be used to calculate the background values.</P>
        <P>(1) Background soil values may be based on a one-time sampling at a background plot having characteristics similar to those of the treatment zone.</P>
        <P>(2) Background soil-pore liquid values must be based on at least quarterly sampling for one year at a background plot having characteristics similar to those of the treatment zone.</P>
        <P>(3) The owner or operator must express all background values in a form necessary for the determination of statistically significant increases under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
        <P>(4) In taking samples used in the determination of all background values, the owner or operator must use an unsaturated zone monitoring system that complies with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
        <P>(d) The owner or operator must conduct soil monitoring and soil-pore liquid monitoring immediately below the treatment zone. The Regional Administrator will specify the frequency and timing of soil and soil-pore liquid monitoring in the facility permit after considering the frequency, timing, and rate of waste application, and the soil permeability. The owner or operator must express the results of soil and soil-pore liquid monitoring in a form necessary for the determination of statistically significant increases under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
        <P>(e) The owner or operator must use consistent sampling and analysis procedures that are designed to ensure sampling results that provide a reliable indication of soil-pore liquid quality and the chemical make-up of the soil below the treatment zone. At a minimum, the owner or operator must implement procedures and techniques for:</P>
        <P>(1) Sample collection;</P>
        <P>(2) Sample preservation and shipment;</P>
        <P>(3) Analytical procedures; and</P>
        <P>(4) Chain of custody control.</P>
        <P>(f) The owner or operator must determine whether there is a statistically significant change over background values for any hazardous constituent to be monitored under paragraph (a) of this section below the treatment zone each time he conducts soil monitoring and soil-pore liquid monitoring under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(1) In determining whether a statistically significant increase has occurred, the owner or operator must compare the value of each constituent, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section, to the background value for that constituent according to the statistical procedure specified in the facility permit under this paragraph.</P>
        <P>(2) The owner or operator must determine whether there has been a statistically significant increase below the treatment zone within a reasonable time period after completion of sampling. The Regional Administrator will specify that time period in the facility permit after considering the complexity of the statistical test and the availability of laboratory facilities to perform the analysis of soil and soil-pore liquid samples.</P>

        <P>(3) The owner or operator must determine whether there is a statistically <PRTPAGE P="548"/>significant increase below the treatment zone using a statistical procedure that provides reasonable confidence that migration from the treatment zone will be identified. The Regional Administrator will specify a statistical procedure in the facility permit that he finds:</P>
        <P>(i) Is appropriate for the distribution of the data used to establish background values; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Provides a reasonable balance between the probability of falsely identifying migration from the treatment zone and the probability of failing to identify real migration from the treatment zone.</P>
        <P>(g) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, that there is a statistically significant increase of hazardous constituents below the treatment zone, he must:</P>
        <P>(1) Notify the Regional Administrator of this finding in writing within seven days. The notification must indicate what constituents have shown statistically significant increases.</P>
        <P>(2) Within 90 days, submit to the Regional Administrator an application for a permit modification to modify the operating practices at the facility in order to maximize the success of degradation, transformation, or immobilization processes in the treatment zone.</P>
        <P>(h) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, that there is a statistically significant increase of hazardous constituents below the treatment zone, he may demonstrate that a source other than regulated units caused the increase or that the increase resulted from an error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation. While the owner or operator may make a demonstration under this paragraph in addition to, or in lieu of, submitting a permit modification application under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, he is not relieved of the requirement to submit a permit modification application within the time specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section unless the demonstration made under this paragraph successfully shows that a source other than regulated units caused the increase or that the increase resulted from an error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation. In making a demonstration under this paragraph, the owner or operator must:</P>
        <P>(1) Notify the Regional Administrator in writing within seven days of determining a statistically significant increase below the treatment zone that he intends to make a determination under this paragraph;</P>
        <P>(2) Within 90 days, submit a report to the Regional Administrator demonstrating that a source other than the regulated units caused the increase or that the increase resulted from error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation;</P>
        <P>(3) Within 90 days, submit to the Regional Administrator an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the unsaturated zone monitoring program at the facility; and</P>
        <P>(4) Continue to monitor in accordance with the unsaturated zone monitoring program established under this section.</P>

        <P>(7) Continue unsaturated zone monitoring in compliance with § 264.278, excect that soil-pore liquid monitoring may be terminated 90 days after the last application of waste to the treatment zone.</P>
        <P>(d) The owner or operator is not subject to regulation under paragraphs (a)(8) and (c) of this section if the Regional Administrator finds that the level of hazardous constituents in the treatment zone soil does not exceed the background value of those constituents by an amount that is statistically significant when using the test specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The owner or operator may submit such a demonstration to the Regional Administrator at any time during the closure or post-closure care periods. For the purposes of this paragraph:</P>
        <P>(1) The owner or operator must establish background soil values and determine whether there is a statistically significant increase over those values for all hazardous constituents specified in the facility permit under § 264.271 (b).</P>
        <P>(i) Background soil values may be based on a one-time sampling of a background plot having characteristics similar to those of the treatment zone.</P>
        <P>(ii) The owner or operator must express background values and values for hazardous constituents in the treatment zone in a form necessary for the determination of statistically significant increases under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) In taking samples used in the determination of background and treatment zone values, the owner or operator must take samples at a sufficient number of sampling points and at appropriate locations and depths to yield samples that represent the chemical make-up of soil that has not been affected by leakage from the treatment zone and the soil within the treatment zone, respectively.</P>
        <P>(3) In determining whether a statistically significant increase has occurred, the owner or operator must compare the value of each constituent in the treatment zone to the background value for that constituent using a statistical procedure that provides reasonable confidence that constituent presence in the treatment zone will be identified. The owner or operator must use a statistical procedure that:</P>

        <P>(i) Is appropriate for the distribution of the data used to establish background values; and<PRTPAGE P="550"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) Provides a reasonable balance between the probability of falsely identifying hazardous constituent presence in the treatment zone and the probability of failing to identify real presence in the treatment zone.</P>
        <P>(e) The owner or operator is not subject to regulation under Subpart F of this chapter if the Regional Administrator finds that the owner or operator satisfies paragraph (d) of this section and if unsaturated zone monitoring under § 264.278 indicates that hazardous constituents have not migrated beyond the treatment zone during the active life of the land treatment unit.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Design and operating requirements.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) Any landfill that is not covered by paragraph (c) of this section or § 265.301(a) of this chapter must have a liner system for all portions of the landfill (except for existing portions of such landfill). The liner system must have:</P>

        <P>(1) A liner that is designed, constructed, and installed to prevent any <PRTPAGE P="551"/>migration of wastes out of the landfill to the adjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water at anytime during the active life (including the closure period) of the landfill. The liner must be constructed of materials that prevent wastes from passing into the liner during the active life of the facility. The liner must be:</P>
        <P>(i) Constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head and external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the waste or leachate to which they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and the stress of daily operation;</P>
        <P>(ii) Placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support to the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner to prevent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression, or uplift; and</P>
        <P>(iii) Installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with the waste or leachate; and</P>
        <P>(2) A leachate collection and removal system immediately above the liner that is designed, constructed, maintained, and operated to collect and remove leachate from the landfill. The Regional Administrator will specify design and operating conditions in the permit to ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm (one foot). The leachate collection and removal system must be:</P>
        <P>(i) Constructed of materials that are:</P>
        <P>(A) Chemically resistant to the waste managed in the landfill and the leachate expected to be generated; and</P>
        <P>(B) Of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover materials, and by any equipment used at the landfill; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Designed and operated to function without clogging through the scheduled closure of the landfill.</P>
        <P>(b) The owner or operator will be exempted from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the Regional Administrator finds, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator, that alternative design and operating practices, together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituents (see § 264.93) into the ground water or surface water at any future time. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Regional Administrator will consider:</P>
        <P>(1) The nature and quantity of the wastes;</P>
        <P>(2) The proposed alternate design and operation;</P>
        <P>(3) The hydrogeologic setting of the facility, including the attenuative capacity and thickness of the liners and soils present between the landfill and ground water or surface water; and</P>
        <P>(4) All other factors which would influence the quality and mobility of the leachate produced and the potential for it to migrate to ground water or surface water.</P>
        <P>(c) The owner or operator of each new landfill unit on which construction commences after January 29, 1992, each lateral expansion of a landfill unit on which construction commences after July 29, 1992, and each replacement of an existing landfill unit that is to commence reuse after July 29, 1992 must install two or more liners and a leachate collection and removal system above and between such liners. “Construction commences” is as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter under “existing facility”.</P>
        <P>(1)(i) The <E T="03">liner system</E> must include:</P>
        <P>(A) A top liner designed and constructed of materials (e.g., a geomembrane) to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into such liner during the active life and post-closure care period; and</P>

        <P>(B) A composite bottom liner, consisting of at least two components. The upper component must be designed and constructed of materials (e.g., a geomembrane) to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into this component during the active life and post-closure care period. The lower component must be designed and constructed of materials to minimize the migration of hazardous constituents if a breach in the upper component were to occur. The lower component must be constructed of at least 3 feet (91 cm) of compacted soil material with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1×10<E T="51">−7</E> cm/sec.</P>

        <P>(ii) The liners must comply with paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="552"/>
        </P>
        <P>(2) The <E T="03">leachate collection and removal system</E> immediately above the top liner must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to collect and remove leachate from the landfill during the active life and post-closure care period. The Regional Administrator will specify design and operating conditions in the permit to ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm (one foot). The leachate collection and removal system must comply with paragraphs (c)(3) (iii) and (iv) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) The <E T="03">leachate collection and removal system</E> between the liners, and immediately above the bottom composite liner in the case of multiple leachate collection and removal systems, is also a <E T="03">leak detection system.</E> This leak detection system must be capable of detecting, collecting, and removing leaks of hazardous constituents at the earliest practicable time through all areas of the top liner likely to be exposed to waste or leachate during the active life and post-closure care period. The requirements for a leak detection system in this paragraph are satisfied by installation of a system that is, at a minimum:</P>
        <P>(i) Constructed with a bottom slope of one percent or more;</P>

        <P>(ii) Constructed of granular drainage materials with a hydraulic conductivity of 1×10<E T="51">−2</E> cm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches (30.5 cm) or more; or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials with a transmissivity of 3×10<E T="51">−5</E> m<SU>2</SU>/sec or more;</P>
        <P>(iii) Constructed of materials that are chemically resistant to the waste managed in the landfill and the leachate expected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover materials, and equipment used at the landfill;</P>
        <P>(iv) Designed and operated to minimize clogging during the active life and post-closure care period; and</P>
        <P>(v) Constructed with sumps and liquid removal methods (e.g., pumps) of sufficient size to collect and remove liquids from the sump and prevent liquids from backing up into the drainage layer. Each unit must have its own sump(s). The design of each sump and removal system must provide a method for measuring and recording the volume of liquids present in the sump and of liquids removed.</P>
        <P>(4) The owner or operator shall collect and remove pumpable liquids in the leak detection system sumps to minimize the head on the bottom liner.</P>
        <P>(5) The owner or operator of a leak detection system that is not located completely above the seasonal high water table must demonstrate that the operation of the leak detection system will not be adversely affected by the presence of ground water.</P>
        <P>(d) The Regional Administrator may approve alternative design or operating practices to those specified in paragraph (c) of this section if the owner or operator demonstrates to the Regional Administrator that such design and operating practices, together with location characteristics:</P>
        <P>(1) Will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituent into the ground water or surface water at least as effectively as the liners and leachate collection and removal systems specified in paragraph (c) of this section; and</P>
        <P>(2) Will allow detection of leaks of hazardous constituents through the top liner at least as effectively.</P>
        <P>(e) The double liner requirement set forth in paragraph (c) of this section may be waived by the Regional Administrator for any monofill, if:</P>
        <P>(1) The monofill contains only hazardous wastes from foundry furnace emission controls or metal casting molding sand, and such wastes do not contain constituents which would render the wastes hazardous for reasons other than the Toxicity Characteristic in § 261.24 of this chapter, with EPA Hazardous Waste Numbers D004 through D017; and</P>
        <P>(2)(i)(A) The monofill has at least one liner for which there is no evidence that such liner is leaking;</P>
        <P>(B) The monofill is located more than one-quarter mile from an “underground source of drinking water” (as that term is defined in 40 CFR 270.2); and</P>

        <P>(C) The monofill is in compliance with generally applicable ground-water monitoring requirements for facilities with permits under RCRA 3005(c); or<PRTPAGE P="553"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) The owner or operator demonstrates that the monofill is located, designed and operated so as to assure that there will be no migration of any hazardous constituent into ground water or surface water at any future time.</P>
        <P>(f) The owner or operator of any replacement landfill unit is exempt from paragraph (c) of this section if:</P>
        <P>(1) The existing unit was constructed in compliance with the design standards of section 3004(o)(1)(A)(i) and (o)(5) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and</P>
        <P>(2) There is no reason to believe that the liner is not functioning as designed.</P>
        <P>(g) The owner or operator must design, construct, operate, and maintain a run-on control system capable of preventing flow onto the active portion of the landfill during peak discharge from at least a 25-year storm.</P>
        <P>(h) The owner or operator must design, construct, operate, and maintain a run-off management system to collect and control at least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year storm.</P>
        <P>(i) Collection and holding facilities (e.g., tanks or basins) associated with run-on and run-off control systems must be emptied or otherwise managed expeditiously after storms to maintain design capacity of the system.</P>
        <P>(j) If the landfill contains any particulate matter which may be subject to wind dispersal, the owner or operator must cover or otherwise manage the landfill to control wind dispersal.</P>
        <P>(k) The Regional Administrator will specify in the permit all design and operating practices that are necessary to ensure that the requirements of this section are satisfied.</P>
        <P>(l) Any permit under RCRA 3005(c) which is issued for a landfill located within the State of Alabama shall require the installation of two or more liners and a leachate collection system above and between such liners, notwithstanding any other provision of RCRA.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Action leakage rate.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) The Regional Administrator shall approve an action leakage rate for landfill units subject to § 264.301(c) or (d). The action leakage rate is the maximum design flow rate that the leak detection system (LDS) can remove without the fluid head on the bottom liner exceeding l foot. The action leakage rate must include an adequate safety margin to allow for uncertainties in the design (e.g., slope, hydraulic conductivity, thickness of drainage material), construction, operation, and location of the LDS, waste and leachate characteristics, likelihood and amounts of other sources of liquids in the LDS, and proposed response actions (e.g., the action leakage rate must consider decreases in the flow capacity of the system over time resulting from siltation and clogging, rib layover and creep of synthetic components of the system, overburden pressures, etc.).</P>
        <P>(b) To determine if the action leakage rate has been exceeded, the owner or operator must convert the weekly or monthly flow rate from the monitoring data obtained under § 264.303(c) to an average daily flow rate (gallons per acre per day) for each sump. Unless the Regional Administrator approves a different calculation, the average daily flow rate for each sump must be calculated weekly during the active life and closure period, and monthly during the post-closure care period when monthly monitoring is required under § 264.303(c).</P>

        <SUBJECT>Monitoring and inspection.</SUBJECT>

        <P>(a) During construction or installation, liners (except in the case of existing portions of landfills exempt from § 264.301(a)) and cover systems (e.g., membranes, sheets, or coatings) must be inspected for uniformity, damage, and imperfections (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> holes, cracks, thin spots, or foreign materials). Immediately after construction or installation:</P>

        <P>(1) Synthetic liners and covers must be inspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence of tears, punctures, or blisters; and<PRTPAGE P="554"/>
        </P>
        <P>(2) Soil-based and admixed liners and covers must be inspected for imperfections including lenses, cracks, channels, root holes, or other structural non-uniformities that may cause an increase in the permeability of the liner or cover.</P>
        <P>(b) While a landfill is in operation, it must be inspected weekly and after storms to detect evidence of any of the following:</P>
        <P>(1) Deterioration, malfunctions, or improper operation of run-on and run-off control systems;</P>
        <P>(2) Proper functioning of wind dispersal control systems, where present; and</P>
        <P>(3) The presence of leachate in and proper functioning of leachate collection and removal systems, where present.</P>
        <P>(c)(1) An owner or operator required to have a leak detection system under § 264.301(c) or (d) must record the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump at least once each week during the active life and closure period.</P>
        <P>(2) After the final cover is installed, the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump must be recorded at least monthly. If the liquid level in the sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months, the amount of liquids in the sumps must be recorded at least quarterly. If the liquid level in the sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive quarters, the amount of liquids in the sumps must be recorded at least semi-annually. If at any time during the post-closure care period the pump operating level is exceeded at units on quarterly or semi-annual recording schedules, the owner or operator must return to monthly recording of amounts of liquids removed from each sump until the liquid level again stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months.</P>
        <P>(3) “Pump operating level” is a liquid level proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator based on pump activation level, sump dimensions, and level that avoids backup into the drainage layer and minimizes head in the sump.</P>

        <P>(2) Submit a preliminary written assessment to the Regional Administrator within 14 days of the determination, as to the amount of liquids, likely sources of liquids, possible location, size, and cause of any leaks, and short-term actions taken and planned;</P>
        <P>(3) Determine to the extent practicable the location, size, and cause of any leak;</P>
        <P>(4) Determine whether waste receipt should cease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be removed from the unit for inspection, repairs, or controls, and whether or not the unit should be closed;</P>

        <P>(ii) Detect and subsequently characterize releases of hazardous constituents to ground water that may occur from areas of the CAMU in which wastes will remain in place after closure of the CAMU.</P>
        <P>(4) Closure and post-closure requirements.</P>
        <P>(i) Closure of corrective action management units shall:</P>
        <P>(A) Minimize the need for further maintenance; and</P>

        <P>(B) Control, minimize, or eliminate, to the extent necessary to protect human health and the environment, for areas where wastes remain in place, post-closure escape of hazardous waste, <PRTPAGE P="564"/>hazardous constituents, leachate, contaminated runoff, or hazardous waste decomposition products to the ground, to surface waters, or to the atmosphere.</P>

        <P>(C) Potential for releases from the CAMU;</P>
        <P>(D) Physical and chemical characteristics of the waste;</P>
        <P>(E) Hydrological and other relevant environmental conditions at the facility which may influence the migration of any potential or actual releases; and</P>
        <P>(F) Potential for exposure of humans and environmental receptors if releases were to occur from the CAMU.</P>
        <P>(iv) Post-closure requirements as necessary to protect human health and the environment, to include, for areas where wastes will remain in place, monitoring and maintenance activities, and the frequency with which such activities shall be performed to ensure the integrity of any cap, final cover, or other containment system.</P>
        <P>(f) The Regional Administrator shall document the rationale for designating CAMUs and shall make such documentation available to the public.</P>
        <P>(g) Incorporation of a CAMU into an existing permit must be approved by the Regional Administrator according to the procedures for Agency-initiated permit modifications under § 270.41 of this chapter, or according to the permit modification procedures of § 270.42 of this chapter.</P>

        <P>(3) Whether the disposal and/or release of the waste occurred before or after the land disposal requirements of part 268 of this chapter were in effect for the waste listing or characteristic.</P>
        <P>(e) The Regional Administrator shall specify, in the permit or order, requirements for CAMUs to include the following:</P>
        <P>(1) The areal configuration of the CAMU.</P>
        <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, requirements for CAMU-eligible waste management to include the specification of applicable design, operation, treatment and closure requirements.</P>
        <P>(3) Minimum design requirements. CAMUs, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, into which wastes are placed must be designed in accordance with the following:</P>

        <P>(i) Unless the Regional Administrator approves alternate requirements under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, CAMUs that consist of new, replacement, or laterally expanded units must include a composite liner and a leachate collection system that is designed and constructed to maintain less than a 30-cm depth of leachate over the liner. For purposes of this section, <E T="03">composite liner</E> means a system consisting of two components; the upper component must consist of a minimum 30-mil flexible membrane liner (FML), and the lower component must consist of at least a two-foot layer of compacted soil with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1×10-7 cm/sec. FML components consisting of high density polyethylene (HDPE) must be at least 60 mil thick. The FML component must be installed in direct and uniform contact with the compacted soil component;</P>
        <P>(ii) Alternate requirements. The Regional Administrator may approve alternate requirements if:</P>
        <P>(A) The Regional Administrator finds that alternate design and operating practices, together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituents into the ground water or surface water at least as effectively as the liner and leachate collection systems in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section; or</P>
        <P>(B) The CAMU is to be established in an area with existing significant levels of contamination, and the Regional Administrator finds that an alternative design, including a design that does not include a liner, would prevent migration from the unit that would exceed long-term remedial goals.</P>
        <P>(4) Minimum treatment requirements: Unless the wastes will be placed in a CAMU for storage and/or treatment only in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, CAMU-eligible wastes that, absent this section, would be subject to the treatment requirements of part 268 of this chapter, and that the Regional Administrator determines contain principal hazardous constituents must be treated to the standards specified in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(i) Principal hazardous constituents are those constituents that the Regional Administrator determines pose a risk to human health and the environment substantially higher than the cleanup levels or goals at the site.</P>
        <P>(A) In general, the Regional Administrator will designate as principal hazardous constituents:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Carcinogens that pose a potential direct risk from ingestion or inhalation at the site at or above 10<E T="51">−3</E>; and</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Non-carcinogens that pose a potential direct risk from ingestion or inhalation at the site an order of magnitude or greater over their reference dose.</P>

        <P>(B) The Regional Administrator will also designate constituents as principal <PRTPAGE P="567"/>hazardous constituents, where appropriate, when risks to human health and the environment posed by the potential migration of constituents in wastes to ground water are substantially higher than cleanup levels or goals at the site; when making such a designation, the Regional Administrator may consider such factors as constituent concentrations, and fate and transport characteristics under site conditions.</P>
        <P>(C) The Regional Administrator may also designate other constituents as principal hazardous constituents that the Regional Administrator determines pose a risk to human health and the environment substantially higher than the cleanup levels or goals at the site.</P>
        <P>(ii) In determining which constituents are “principal hazardous constituents,” the Regional Administrator must consider all constituents which, absent this section, would be subject to the treatment requirements in 40 CFR part 268.</P>
        <P>(iii) Waste that the Regional Administrator determines contains principal hazardous constituents must meet treatment standards determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iv) or (e)(4)(v) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iv) Treatment standards for wastes placed in CAMUs.</P>
        <P>(A) For non-metals, treatment must achieve 90 percent reduction in total principal hazardous constituent concentrations, except as provided by paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section.</P>
        <P>(B) For metals, treatment must achieve 90 percent reduction in principal hazardous constituent concentrations as measured in leachate from the treated waste or media (tested according to the TCLP) or 90 percent reduction in total constituent concentrations (when a metal removal treatment technology is used), except as provided by paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section.</P>
        <P>(C) When treatment of any principal hazardous constituent to a 90 percent reduction standard would result in a concentration less than 10 times the Universal Treatment Standard for that constituent, treatment to achieve constituent concentrations less than 10 times the Universal Treatment Standard is not required. Universal Treatment Standards are identified in § 268.48 Table UTS of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(D) For waste exhibiting the hazardous characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity or reactivity, the waste must also be treated to eliminate these characteristics.</P>
        <P>(E) For debris, the debris must be treated in accordance with § 268.45 of this chapter, or by methods or to levels established under paragraphs (e)(4)(iv)(A) through (D) or paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section, whichever the Regional Administrator determines is appropriate.</P>
        <P>(F) Alternatives to TCLP. For metal bearing wastes for which metals removal treatment is not used, the Regional Administrator may specify a leaching test other than the TCLP (SW846 Method 1311, 40 CFR 260.11(c)(3)(v)) to measure treatment effectiveness, provided the Regional Administrator determines that an alternative leach testing protocol is appropriate for use, and that the alternative more accurately reflects conditions at the site that affect leaching.</P>
        <P>(v) Adjusted standards. The Regional Administrator may adjust the treatment level or method in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section to a higher or lower level, based on one or more of the following factors, as appropriate. The adjusted level or method must be protective of human health and the environment:</P>
        <P>(A) The technical impracticability of treatment to the levels or by the methods in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section;</P>
        <P>(B) The levels or methods in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section would result in concentrations of principal hazardous constituents (PHCs) that are significantly above or below cleanup standards applicable to the site (established either site-specifically, or promulgated under state or federal law);</P>

        <P>(C) The views of the affected local community on the treatment levels or methods in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section as applied at the site, and, for treatment levels, the treatment methods necessary to achieve these levels;<PRTPAGE P="568"/>
        </P>
        <P>(D) The short-term risks presented by the on-site treatment method necessary to achieve the levels or treatment methods in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section;</P>
        <P>(E) The long-term protection offered by the engineering design of the CAMU and related engineering controls:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Where the treatment standards in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section are substantially met and the principal hazardous constituents in the waste or residuals are of very low mobility; or</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Where cost-effective treatment has been used and the CAMU meets the Subtitle C liner and leachate collection requirements for new land disposal units at § 264.301(c) and (d); or</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Where, after review of appropriate treatment technologies, the Regional Administrator determines that cost-effective treatment is not reasonably available, and the CAMU meets the Subtitle C liner and leachate collection requirements for new land disposal units at § 264.301(c) and (d); or</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Where cost-effective treatment has been used and the principal hazardous constituents in the treated wastes are of very low mobility; or</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Where, after review of appropriate treatment technologies, the Regional Administrator determines that cost-effective treatment is not reasonably available, the principal hazardous constituents in the wastes are of very low mobility, and either the CAMU meets or exceeds the liner standards for new, replacement, or laterally expanded CAMUs in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, or the CAMU provides substantially equivalent or greater protection.</P>
        <P>(vi) The treatment required by the treatment standards must be completed prior to, or within a reasonable time after, placement in the CAMU.</P>
        <P>(vii) For the purpose of determining whether wastes placed in CAMUs have met site-specific treatment standards, the Regional Administrator may, as appropriate, specify a subset of the principal hazardous constituents in the waste as analytical surrogates for determining whether treatment standards have been met for other principal hazardous constituents. This specification will be based on the degree of difficulty of treatment and analysis of constituents with similar treatment properties.</P>
        <P>(5) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, requirements for ground water monitoring and corrective action that are sufficient to:</P>
        <P>(i) Continue to detect and to characterize the nature, extent, concentration, direction, and movement of existing releases of hazardous constituents in ground water from sources located within the CAMU; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Detect and subsequently characterize releases of hazardous constituents to ground water that may occur from areas of the CAMU in which wastes will remain in place after closure of the CAMU; and</P>
        <P>(iii) Require notification to the Regional Administrator and corrective action as necessary to protect human health and the environment for releases to ground water from the CAMU.</P>
        <P>(6) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, closure and post-closure requirements:</P>
        <P>(i) Closure of corrective action management units shall:</P>
        <P>(A) Minimize the need for further maintenance; and</P>
        <P>(B) Control, minimize, or eliminate, to the extent necessary to protect human health and the environment, for areas where wastes remain in place, post-closure escape of hazardous wastes, hazardous constituents, leachate, contaminated runoff, or hazardous waste decomposition products to the ground, to surface waters, or to the atmosphere.</P>
        <P>(ii) Requirements for closure of CAMUs shall include the following, as appropriate and as deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator for a given CAMU:</P>
        <P>(A) Requirements for excavation, removal, treatment or containment of wastes; and</P>
        <P>(B) Requirements for removal and decontamination of equipment, devices, and structures used in CAMU-eligible waste management activities within the CAMU.</P>
        <P>(iii) In establishing specific closure requirements for CAMUs under paragraph (e) of this section, the Regional Administrator shall consider the following factors:</P>
        <P>(A) CAMU characteristics;<PRTPAGE P="569"/>
        </P>
        <P>(B) Volume of wastes which remain in place after closure;</P>
        <P>(C) Potential for releases from the CAMU;</P>
        <P>(D) Physical and chemical characteristics of the waste;</P>
        <P>(E) Hydrogeological and other relevant environmental conditions at the facility which may influence the migration of any potential or actual releases; and</P>

        <SUBJECT>Staging piles.</SUBJECT>

        <P>This section is written in a special format to make it easier to understand the regulatory requirements. Like other Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, this establishes enforceable legal requirements. For <PRTPAGE P="571"/>this “I” and “you” refer to the owner/operator.</P>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">What is a staging pile?</E> A staging pile is an accumulation of solid, non-flowing remediation waste (as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter) that is not a containment building and is used only during remedial operations for temporary storage at a facility. A staging pile must be located within the contiguous property under the control of the owner/operator where the wastes to be managed in the staging pile originated. Staging piles must be designated by the Director according to the requirements in this section.</P>
        <P>(1) For the purposes of this section, storage includes mixing, sizing, blending, or other similar physical operations as long as they are intended to prepare the wastes for subsequent management or treatment.</P>
        <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">When may I use a staging pile?</E> You may use a staging pile to store hazardous remediation waste (or remediation waste otherwise subject to land disposal restrictions) only if you follow the standards and design criteria the Director has designated for that staging pile. The Director must designate the staging pile in a permit or, at an interim status facility, in a closure plan or order (consistent with § 270.72(a)(5) and (b)(5) of this chapter). The Director must establish conditions in the permit, closure plan, or order that comply with paragraphs (d) through (k) of this section.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">What information must I provide to get a staging pile designated?</E> When seeking a staging pile designation, you must provide:</P>
        <P>(1) Sufficient and accurate information to enable the Director to impose standards and design criteria for your staging pile according to paragraphs (d) through (k) of this section;</P>
        <P>(2) Certification by a qualified Professional Engineer for technical data, such as design drawings and specifications, and engineering studies, unless the Director determines, based on information that you provide, that this certification is not necessary to ensure that a staging pile will protect human health and the environment; and</P>
        <P>(3) Any additional information the Director determines is necessary to protect human health and the environment.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">What performance criteria must a staging pile satisfy?</E> The Director must establish the standards and design criteria for the staging pile in the permit, closure plan, or order.</P>
        <P>(1) The standards and design criteria must comply with the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The staging pile must facilitate a reliable, effective and protective remedy;</P>
        <P>(ii) The staging pile must be designed so as to prevent or minimize releases of hazardous wastes and hazardous constituents into the environment, and minimize or adequately control cross-media transfer, as necessary to protect human health and the environment (for example, through the use of liners, covers, run-off/run-on controls, as appropriate); and</P>
        <P>(iii) The staging pile must not operate for more than two years, except when the Director grants an operating term extension under paragraph (i) of this section (entitled “May I receive an operating extension for a staging pile?”). You must measure the two-year limit, or other operating term specified by the Director in the permit, closure plan, or order, from the first time you place remediation waste into a staging pile. You must maintain a record of the date when you first placed remediation waste into the staging pile for the life of the permit, closure plan, or order, or for three years, whichever is longer.</P>
        <P>(2) In setting the standards and design criteria, the Director must consider the following factors:</P>
        <P>(i) Length of time the pile will be in operation;</P>
        <P>(ii) Volumes of wastes you intend to store in the pile;</P>
        <P>(iii) Physical and chemical characteristics of the wastes to be stored in the unit;</P>
        <P>(iv) Potential for releases from the unit;</P>
        <P>(v) Hydrogeological and other relevant environmental conditions at the facility that may influence the migration of any potential releases; and</P>

        <P>(vi) Potential for human and environmental exposure to potential releases from the unit;<PRTPAGE P="572"/>
        </P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">May a staging pile receive ignitable or reactive remediation waste?</E> You must not place ignitable or reactive remediation waste in a staging pile unless:</P>
        <P>(1) You have treated, rendered or mixed the remediation waste before you placed it in the staging pile so that:</P>
        <P>(i) The remediation waste no longer meets the definition of ignitable or reactive under § 261.21 or § 261.23 of this chapter; and</P>
        <P>(ii) You have complied with § 264.17(b); or</P>
        <P>(2) You manage the remediation waste to protect it from exposure to any material or condition that may cause it to ignite or react.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">How do I handle incompatible remediation wastes in a staging pile?</E> The term “incompatible waste” is defined in § 260.10 of this chapter. You must comply with the following requirements for incompatible wastes in staging piles:</P>
        <P>(1) You must not place incompatible remediation wastes in the same staging pile unless you have complied with § 264.17(b);</P>
        <P>(2) If remediation waste in a staging pile is incompatible with any waste or material stored nearby in containers, other piles, open tanks or land disposal units (for example, surface impoundments), you must separate the incompatible materials, or protect them from one another by using a dike, berm, wall or other device; and</P>
        <P>(3) You must not pile remediation waste on the same base where incompatible wastes or materials were previously piled, unless the base has been decontaminated sufficiently to comply with § 264.17(b).</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Are staging piles subject to Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) and Minimum Technological Requirements (MTR)?</E> No. Placing hazardous remediation wastes into a staging pile does not constitute land disposal of hazardous wastes or create a unit that is subject to the minimum technological requirements of RCRA 3004(o).</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">How long may I operate a staging pile?</E> The Director may allow a staging pile to operate for up to two years after hazardous remediation waste is first placed into the pile. You must use a staging pile no longer than the length of time designated by the Director in the permit, closure plan, or order (the “operating term”), except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">May I receive an operating extension for a staging pile?</E> (1) The Director may grant one operating term extension of up to 180 days beyond the operating term limit contained in the permit, closure plan, or order (see paragraph (l) of this section for modification procedures). To justify to the Director the need for an extension, you must provide sufficient and accurate information to enable the Director to determine that continued operation of the staging pile:</P>
        <P>(i) Will not pose a threat to human health and the environment; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Is necessary to ensure timely and efficient implementation of remedial actions at the facility.</P>
        <P>(2) The Director may, as a condition of the extension, specify further standards and design criteria in the permit, closure plan, or order, as necessary, to ensure protection of human health and the environment.</P>
        <P>(j) <E T="03">What is the closure requirement for a staging pile located in a previously contaminated area?</E> (1) Within 180 days after the operating term of the staging pile expires, you must close a staging pile located in a previously contaminated area of the site by removing or decontaminating all:</P>
        <P>(i) Remediation waste;</P>
        <P>(ii) Contaminated containment system components; and</P>
        <P>(iii) Structures and equipment contaminated with waste and leachate.</P>
        <P>(2) You must also decontaminate contaminated subsoils in a manner and according to a schedule that the Director determines will protect human health and the environment.</P>
        <P>(3) The Director must include the above requirements in the permit, closure plan, or order in which the staging pile is designated.</P>
        <P>(k) <E T="03">What is the closure requirement for a staging pile located in an uncontaminated area?</E> (1) Within 180 days after the operating term of the staging pile expires, you must close a staging pile located in an uncontaminated area of the site according to §§ 264.258(a) and 264.111; or <PRTPAGE P="573"/>according to §§ 265.258(a) and 265.111 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(2) The Director must include the above requirement in the permit, closure plan, or order in which the staging pile is designated.</P>
        <P>(l) <E T="03">How may my existing permit (for example, RAP), closure plan, or order be modified to allow me to use a staging pile?</E> (1) To modify a permit, other than a RAP, to incorporate a staging pile or staging pile operating term extension, either:</P>
        <P>(i) The Director must approve the modification under the procedures for Agency-initiated permit modifications in § 270.41 of this chapter; or</P>
        <P>(ii) You must request a Class 2 modification under § 270.42 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(2) To modify a RAP to incorporate a staging pile or staging pile operating term extension, you must comply with the RAP modification requirements under §§ 270.170 and 270.175 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(3) To modify a closure plan to incorporate a staging pile or staging pile operating term extension, you must follow the applicable requirements under § 264.112(c) or § 265.112(c) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(4) To modify an order to incorporate a staging pile or staging pile operating term extension, you must follow the terms of the order and the applicable provisions of § 270.72(a)(5) or (b)(5) of this chapter.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Disposal of CAMU-eligible wastes in permitted hazardous waste landfills.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) The Regional Administrator with regulatory oversight at the location where the cleanup is taking place may approve placement of CAMU-eligible wastes in hazardous waste landfills not located at the site from which the waste originated, without the wastes meeting the requirements of RCRA 40 CFR part 268, if the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section are met:</P>
        <P>(1) The waste meets the definition of CAMU-eligible waste in § 264.552(a)(1) and (2).</P>
        <P>(2) The Regional Administrator with regulatory oversight at the location where the cleanup is taking place identifies principal hazardous constitutes in such waste, in accordance with § 264.552(e)(4)(i) and (ii), and requires that such principal hazardous constituents are treated to any of the following standards specified for CAMU-eligible wastes:</P>
        <P>(i) The treatment standards under § 264.552(e)(4)(iv); or</P>

        <P>(ii) Treatment standards adjusted in accordance with § 264.552(e)(4)(v)(A), (C), (D) or (E)(<E T="03">1</E>); or</P>

        <P>(iii) Treatment standards adjusted in accordance with § 264.552(e)(4)(v)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>), where treatment has been used and that treatment significantly reduces the toxicity or mobility of the principal hazardous constituents in the waste, minimizing the short-term and long-term threat posed by the waste, including the threat at the remediation site.</P>
        <P>(3) The landfill receiving the CAMU-eligible waste must have a RCRA hazardous waste permit, meet the requirements for new landfills in Subpart N of this part, and be authorized to accept CAMU-eligible wastes; for the purposes of this requirement, “permit” does not include interim status.</P>
        <P>(b) The person seeking approval shall provide sufficient information to enable the Regional Administrator with regulatory oversight at the location where the cleanup is taking place to approve placement of CAMU-eligible waste in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. Information required by § 264.552(d)(1) through (3) for CAMU applications must be provided, unless not reasonably available.</P>

        <P>(c) The Regional Administrator with regulatory oversight at the location where the cleanup is taking place shall provide public notice and a reasonable opportunity for public comment before approving CAMU eligible waste for placement in an off-site permitted hazardous waste landfill, consistent with the requirements for CAMU approval <PRTPAGE P="574"/>at § 264.552(h). The approval must be specific to a single remediation.</P>

        <P>(4) For the purpose of making compliance determinations, the time-weighted average of the results of the three runs shall apply. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, <PRTPAGE P="591"/>extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances beyond the owner or operator's control, compliance may, upon the Regional Administrator's approval, be determined using the average of the results of the two other runs.</P>
        <P>(d) To show that a process vent associated with a hazardous waste distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation is not subject to the requirements of this subpart, the owner or operator must make an initial determination that the time-weighted, annual average total organic concentration of the waste managed by the waste management unit is less than 10 ppmw using one of the following two methods:</P>
        <P>(1) Direct measurement of the organic concentration of the waste using the following procedures:</P>
        <P>(i) The owner or operator must take a minimum of four grab samples of waste for each waste stream managed in the affected unit under process conditions expected to cause the maximum waste organic concentration.</P>
        <P>(ii) For waste generated onsite, the grab samples must be collected at a point before the waste is exposed to the atmosphere such as in an enclosed pipe or other closed system that is used to transfer the waste after generation to the first affected distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation. For waste generated offsite, the grab samples must be collected at the inlet to the first waste management unit that receives the waste provided the waste has been transferred to the facility in a closed system such as a tank truck and the waste is not diluted or mixed with other waste.</P>
        <P>(iii) Each sample shall be analyzed and the total organic concentration of the sample shall be computed using Method 9060A (incorporated by reference under 40 CFR 260.11) of “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW-846, or analyzed for its individual organic constituents.</P>
        <P>(iv) The arithmetic mean of the results of the analyses of the four samples shall apply for each waste stream managed in the unit in determining the time-weighted, annual average total organic concentration of the waste. The time-weighted average is to be calculated using the annual quantity of each waste stream processed and the mean organic concentration of each waste stream managed in the unit.</P>
        <P>(2) Using knowledge of the waste to determine that its total organic concentration is less than 10 ppmw. Documentation of the waste determination is required. Examples of documentation that shall be used to support a determination under this provision include production process information documenting that no organic compounds are used, information that the waste is generated by a process that is identical to a process at the same or another facility that has previously been demonstrated by direct measurement to generate a waste stream having a total organic content less than 10 ppmw, or prior speciation analysis results on the same waste stream where it can also be documented that no process changes have occurred since that analysis that could affect the waste total organic concentration.</P>
        <P>(e) The determination that distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operations manage hazardous wastes with time-weighted, annual average total organic concentrations less than 10 ppmw shall be made as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) By the effective date that the facility becomes subject to the provisions of this subpart or by the date when the waste is first managed in a waste management unit, whichever is later, and</P>
        <P>(2) For continuously generated waste, annually, or</P>
        <P>(3) Whenever there is a change in the waste being managed or a change in the process that generates or treats the waste.</P>

        <P>(f) When an owner or operator and the Regional Administrator do not agree on whether a distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation manages a hazardous waste with organic concentrations of at least 10 ppmw based on knowledge of the waste, the dispute may be resolved <PRTPAGE P="592"/>by using direct measurement as specified at paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 264.1101</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Design and operating standards.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) All containment buildings must comply with the following design standards:</P>
        <P>(1) The containment building must be completely enclosed with a floor, walls, and a roof to prevent exposure to the elements, (e.g., precipitation, wind, run-on), and to assure containment of managed wastes.</P>
        <P>(2) The floor and containment walls of the unit, including the secondary containment system if required under paragraph (b) of this section, must be designed and constructed of materials of sufficient strength and thickness to support themselves, the waste contents, and any personnel and heavy equipment that operate within the unit, and to prevent failure due to pressure gradients, settlement, compression, or uplift, physical contact with the hazardous wastes to which they are exposed; climatic conditions; and the stresses of daily operation, including the movement of heavy equipment within the unit and contact of such equipment with containment walls. The unit must be designed so that it has sufficient structural strength to prevent collapse or other failure. All surfaces to be in contact with hazardous wastes must be chemically compatible with those wastes. EPA will consider standards established by professional organizations generally recognized by the industry such as the American Concrete Institute (ACI) and the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) in judging the structural integrity requirements of this paragraph. If appropriate to the nature of the waste management operation to take place in the unit, an exception to the structural strength requirement may be made for light-weight doors and windows that meet these criteria:</P>
        <P>(i) They provide an effective barrier against fugitive dust emissions under paragraph (c)(1)(iv); and</P>
        <P>(ii) The unit is designed and operated in a fashion that assures that wastes will not actually come in contact with these openings.</P>
        <P>(3) Incompatible hazardous wastes or treatment reagents must not be placed in the unit or its secondary containment system if they could cause the unit or secondary containment system to leak, corrode, or otherwise fail.</P>
        <P>(4) A containment building must have a primary barrier designed to withstand the movement of personnel, waste, and handling equipment in the unit during the operating life of the unit and appropriate for the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste to be managed.</P>
        <P>(b) For a containment building used to manage hazardous wastes containing free liquids or treated with free -liquids (the presence of which is de-ter-mined by the paint filter test, a visual examination, or other appropriate means), the owner or operator must -include:</P>
        <P>(1) A primary barrier designed and constructed of materials to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into the barrier (e.g., a geomembrane covered by a concrete wear surface).</P>
        <P>(2) A liquid collection and removal system to minimize the accumulation of liquid on the primary barrier of the containment building:</P>
        <P>(i) The primary barrier must be sloped to drain liquids to the associated collection system; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Liquids and waste must be collected and removed to minimize hydraulic head on the containment system at the earliest practicable time.</P>

        <P>(3) A secondary containment system including a secondary barrier designed and constructed to prevent migration of hazardous constituents into the barrier, and a leak detection system that is capable of detecting failure of the <PRTPAGE P="654"/>primary barrier and collecting accumulated hazardous wastes and liquids at the earliest practicable time.</P>
        <P>(i) The requirements of the leak detection component of the secondary containment system are satisfied by installation of a system that is, at a minimum:</P>
        <P>(A) Constructed with a bottom slope of 1 percent or more; and</P>

        <P>(B) Constructed of a granular drainage material with a hydraulic conductivity of 1× 10<E T="51">−2</E> cm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches (30.5 cm) or more, or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials with a transmissivity of 3 × 10<E T="51">−5</E> m<SU>2</SU>/sec or more.</P>
        <P>(ii) If treatment is to be conducted in the building, an area in which such treatment will be conducted must be designed to prevent the release of liquids, wet materials, or liquid aerosols to other portions of the building.</P>
        <P>(iii) The secondary containment system must be constructed of materials that are chemically resistant to the waste and liquids managed in the containment building and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressure exerted by overlaying materials and by any equipment used in the containment building. (Containment buildings can serve as secondary containment systems for tanks placed within the building under certain conditions. A containment building can serve as an external liner system for a tank, provided it meets the requirements of § 264.193(e)(1). In addition, the containment building must meet the requirements of § 264.193(b) and §§ 264.193(c) (1) and (2) to be considered an acceptable secondary containment system for a tank.)</P>
        <P>(4) For existing units other than 90-day generator units, the Regional Administrator may delay the secondary containment requirement for up to two years, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator that the unit substantially meets the standards of this subpart. In making this demonstration, the owner or operator must:</P>
        <P>(i) Provide written notice to the Regional Administrator of their request by November 16, 1992. This notification must describe the unit and its operating practices with specific reference to the performance of existing containment systems, and specific plans for retrofitting the unit with secondary containment;</P>
        <P>(ii) Respond to any comments from the Regional Administrator on these plans within 30 days; and</P>
        <P>(iii) Fulfill the terms of the revised plans, if such plans are approved by the Regional Administrator.</P>
        <P>(c) Owners or operators of all containment buildings must:</P>
        <P>(1) Use controls and practices to ensure containment of the ha-zar-dous waste within the unit; and, at a -minimum:</P>
        <P>(i) Maintain the primary barrier to be free of significant cracks, gaps, corrosion, or other deterioration that could cause hazardous waste to be released from the primary barrier;</P>
        <P>(ii) Maintain the level of the stored/treated hazardous waste within the containment walls of the unit so that the height of any containment wall is not exceeded;</P>
        <P>(iii) Take measures to prevent the tracking of hazardous waste out of the unit by personnel or by equipment used in handling the waste. An area must be designated to decontaminate equipment and any rinsate must be collected and properly managed; and</P>
        <P>(iv) Take measures to control fugitive dust emissions such that any openings (doors, windows, vents, cracks, etc.) exhibit no visible emissions (see 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 22—Visual Determination of Fugitive Emissions from Material Sources and Smoke Emissions from Flares). In addition, all associated particulate collection devices (e.g., fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator) must be operated and maintained with sound air pollution control practices (see 40 CFR part 60 subpart 292 for guidance). This state of no visible emissions must be maintained effectively at all times during routine operating and maintenance conditions, including when vehicles and personnel are entering and exiting the unit.</P>

        <P>(2) Obtain and keep on-site a certification by a qualified Professional Engineer that the containment building design meets the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="655"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) Throughout the active life of the containment building, if the owner or operator detects a condition that could lead to or has caused a release of hazardous waste, the owner or operator must repair the condition promptly, in accordance with the following procedures.</P>
        <P>(i) Upon detection of a condition that has led to a release of hazardous waste (e.g., upon detection of leakage from the primary barrier) the owner or operator must:</P>
        <P>(A) Enter a record of the discovery in the facility operating record;</P>
        <P>(B) Immediately remove the portion of the containment building affected by the condition from service;</P>
        <P>(C) Determine what steps must be taken to repair the containment building, remove any leakage from the secondary collection system, and establish a schedule for accomplishing the cleanup and repairs; and</P>
        <P>(D) Within 7 days after the discovery of the condition, notify the Regional Administrator of the condition, and within 14 working days, provide a written notice to the Regional Administrator with a description of the steps taken to repair the containment building, and the schedule for accomplishing the work.</P>
        <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator will review the information submitted, make a determination regarding whether the containment building must be removed from service completely or partially until repairs and cleanup are complete, and notify the owner or operator of the de-ter-min-a-tion and the underlying rationale in writing.</P>
        <P>(iii) Upon completing all repairs and cleanup the owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator in writing and provide a verification, signed by a qualified, registered professional engineer, that the repairs and cleanup have been completed according to the written plan submitted in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section.</P>
        <P>(4) Inspect and record in the facility's operating record, at least once every seven days, except for Performance Track member facilities that must inspect at least once each month, upon approval by the Director, data gathered from monitoring and leak detection equipment as well as the containment building and the area immediately surrounding the containment building to detect signs of releases of hazardous waste. To apply for reduced inspection frequency, the Performance Track member facility must follow the procedures described in § 264.15(b)(5).</P>
        <P>(d) For a containment building that contains both areas with and without secondary containment, the owner or operator must:</P>
        <P>(1) Design and operate each area in accordance with the requirements enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section;</P>
        <P>(2) Take measures to prevent the release of liquids or wet materials into areas without secondary containment; and</P>
        <P>(3) Maintain in the facility's operating log a written description of the operating procedures used to maintain the integrity of areas without secondary containment.</P>
        <P>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart the Regional Administrator may waive requirements for secondary containment for a permitted containment building where the owner operator demonstrates that the only free liquids in the unit are limited amounts of dust suppression liquids required to meet occupational health and safety requirements, and where containment of managed wastes and liquids can be assured without a secondary containment system.</P>

        <P>Using all the available background data (n<E T="52">b</E> readings), calculate the background mean (X<E T="52">b</E>) and background variance (s<E T="52">b</E>2). For the single monitoring well under investigation (n<E T="52">m</E> reading), calculate the monitoring mean (X<E T="52">m</E>) and monitoring variance (s<E T="52">m</E>2).</P>
        <P>For any set of data (X<E T="52">1</E>, X<E T="52">2</E>, . . ., X<E T="52">n</E>) the mean is calculated by:</P>
        <MATH DEEP="24" SPAN="1">
          <MID>EC15NO91.174</MID>
        </MATH>
        <FP>and the variance is calculated by:</FP>
        <MATH DEEP="30" SPAN="1">
          <MID>EC15NO91.175</MID>
        </MATH>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">where “n” denotes the number of observations in the set of data.</FP>
        

        <P>The t-test uses these data summary measures to calculate a t-statistic (t*) and a comparison t-statistic (t<E T="52">c</E>). The t* value is compared to the t<E T="52">c</E> value and a conclusion reached as to whether there has been a statistically significant change in any indicator parameter.</P>
        <P>The t-statistic for all parameters except pH and similar monitoring parameters is:</P>
        <MATH DEEP="046" SPAN="1">
          <MID>er26oc93.011</MID>
        </MATH>
        <FP>If the value of this t-statistic is negative then there is no significant difference between the monitoring data and background data. It should be noted that significantly small negative values may be indicative of a failure of the assumption made for test validity or errors have been made in collecting the background data.</FP>
        <P>The t-statistic (t<E T="52">c</E>), against which t* will be compared, necessitates finding t<E T="52">b</E> and t<E T="52">m</E> from standard (one-tailed) tables where,</P>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">t<E T="52">b</E> = t-tables with (n<E T="52">b</E>−1) degrees of freedom, at the 0.05 level of significance.</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">t<E T="52">m</E> = t-tables with (n<E T="52">m</E>−1) degrees of freedom, at the 0.05 level of significance.</FP>
        
        <P>Finally, the special weightings W<E T="52">b</E> and W<E T="52">m</E> are defined as:</P>

          <MID>EC15NO91.176</MID>
        </MATH>
        <FP>and so the comparison t-statistic is:</FP>
        <MATH DEEP="27" SPAN="1">
          <MID>EC15NO91.177</MID>
        </MATH>

        <P>The t-statistic (t*) is now compared with the comparison t-statistic (t<E T="52">c</E>) using the following decision-rule:</P>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">If <E T="03">t* is equal to or larger than</E> t<E T="52">c</E>, then conclude that there most likely <E T="03">has been a significant increase</E> in this specific parameter.</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">If <E T="03">t* is less than</E> t<E T="52">c</E>, then conclude that most likely <E T="03">there has not been a change</E> in this specific parameter.</FP>
        

        <P>The t-statistic for testing pH and similar monitoring parameters is constructed in the same manner as previously described except the negative sign (if any) is discarded and the caveat concerning the negative value is ignored. The standard (two-tailed) tables are used in the construction t<E T="52">c</E> for pH and similar monitoring parameters.</P>
        <P>If t* is equal to or larger than t<E T="52">c</E>, then conclude that there most likely <E T="03">has been a significant increase</E> (if the initial t* had been negative, this would imply a significant decrease). If t* is less than t<E T="52">c</E>, then conclude that there most likely has been no change.<PRTPAGE P="660"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix V to Part 264—Examples of Potentially Incompatible Waste</HD>
        <P>Many hazardous wastes, when mixed with other waste or materials at a hazardous waste facility, can produce effects which are harmful to human health and the environment, such as (1) heat or pressure, (2) fire or explosion, (3) violent reaction, (4) toxic dusts, mists, fumes, or gases, or (5) flammable fumes or gases.</P>
        <P>Below are examples of potentially incompatible wastes, waste components, and materials, along with the harmful consequences which result from mixing materials in one group with materials in another group. The list is intended as a guide to owners or operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities, and to enforcement and permit granting officials, to indicate the need for special precautions when managing these potentially incompatible waste materials or components.</P>
        <P>This list is not intended to be exhaustive. An owner or operator must, as the regulations require, adequately analyze his wastes so that he can avoid creating uncontrolled substances or reactions of the type listed below, whether they are listed below or not.</P>
        <P>It is possible for potentially incompatible wastes to be mixed in a way that precludes a reaction (e.g., adding acid to water rather than water to acid) or that neutralizes them (e.g., a strong acid mixed with a strong base), or that controls substances produced (e.g., by generating flammable gases in -a closed tank equipped so that ignition can-not occur, and burning the gases in an -incinerator).</P>
        <P>In the lists below, the mixing of a Group A material with a Group B material may have the potential consequence as noted.</P>
